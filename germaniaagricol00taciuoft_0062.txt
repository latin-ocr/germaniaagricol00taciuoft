48 DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE.

durant. Luitur enim etiam homicidium certo armento-
rum ac pecorum numero, recipitque satisfactionem uni-
versa domus: utiliter in publicum; quia periculosiores
sunt inimicitiae juxta libertatem. Convictibus et hospitiis
non alia gens effusius indulget. Quemcunque mortalium
arcere tecto nefas habetur: pro fortuna quisque appa-
ratis epulis excipit. Cum defecere, qui modo hospes
fuerat, monstrator hospitii et comes, proximam domum
non invitati adeunt: nec interest: pari humanitate ac-
cipiuntur. Notum ignotumque, quantum ad jus hospitii,
nemo discernit. Abeunti‚ si quid poposcerit, concedere
moris: et poscendi invicem eadem facilitas. Gaudent
muneribus: sed nec data imputant nec acceptis obli-

gantur.

Luz'tur enim . . . homicidium] This
plan of atoning for homicide is
found in many uncivilized peoples.
It existed amongst the Greeks
(Iliad ix. 632, καὶ μέν τίς τε
κασιγνήτοιο φονῆος ποινὴν ἢ οὗ
’παιδὸς ἐδέξατο τεθνηῶτος), La-
tins, Franks, Saxons, welsh, and
Irish3 and there are various words,
denoting in different languages
the same thing,—7rotv75‚ ‘niulcta,'
‘ we1·(·gild,' '' manbote,' ⁶ sarhaadss
‘eries' &c. The amount of this
paynient was regulated by the sta-
tion of the person killed3 so much
for a peasant, more for a noble, and
so on. lt is cui-ious that, amongst
the Saxons, although homicide was
thus atoned for by a fixed payment,
certain offences in our eyes, of less
atrochy, such as stealing a horse,
were made capital. Ι suppose
amongst a wal-like and fierce people
the slaughter osan adversary, carry-
ing with it the idea of manliness
aud prowess, was not regarded
harshly.

recipitque satisfizetz'onem] It is
not very certain what this expres-
sion means. Some make it to imply
that the entire house undertook to
be responsible for the payment of
the fine imposed on any single
member of it. This sense of
‘recipio' is no doubt common

Victus inter hospites comis.

enough3 and Ῑ believe there really
did subsequently exist amongst some
of the Teutonic people a law to
this effect. still Ι rather think it
means, that the whole house is
bound to rest contented with the
payment thus made, and has no
right afterwards to carry on the feud
longer.

Convictibus et hospitiis] of these
words the former refers to hospi-
tality shown to friends, the latter
to strangers.

nefus habeiur] A law of the
Burgundians punished by a fine any
one who refused shelter to a chance
visitor. This unbounded hospitality
is one of the virtues of uncivilized
races.

monstrator hospitii] The man
who lately supplied the feast points
out a new entertainer, and accom-
panies his late guest there.

imputant] This word properly
means, to enter into one's accounts,
to put down any thing to a person's
credit, and score 'it off against him.
lt is not employed by the Augustan
writers in this sense, and only came
into use in the silver age, amongst
the writers of which it is very com-
mon. Its sense will be best un-
derstood from the following passages:
‘Noli imputare vanum beneficium
mihi’ (Phaedrus, i. 22), i. e. ‘do
