a desire to pry into the exact state
of his health.'

momenta deficientis] The gradual
steps in Agricola's decline, the dying
man being probably· at his Alban
villa some distance from Rome,
were reported to the Emperor by
runners placed for the purpose in
readiness.

animo vultuque] ‘ Animus' is a
little obscure here. By ‘feeling'
Tacitus seems to mean rather its
outward manifestation3 the external
syniptoms of the working of the mind
within, every emotion betraying
itself in some corresponding visible
movement or gesture.

piissimae filiae] Cicero jeers at
Antonius for using the phrase ‘ piis-

verbum nullum omnino est). Ta-
citus, however, compares ‘strenuus'
in the same way, making the super-
lative “ strenuissimus' instead of the
usual ‘maxime strenuus.' ‘Piis-
simus' is frequently used by late
writers, Seneca, Quinctilian, and
others of the Silver Age.

nisi malum principem] Because
under a grasping ruler the dying
hoped, by leaving a part of their
wealth to the emperor, to secure the

rest to their children. Cf. A. xvi. ll, . ”

“ Nec defuere qui monerent magna
ex parte heredem Caesarem nun-
cupare atque ita nepotibus de reliquo
consulere.” Tiberius had the grace to
decline such legacies.

reading ‘ sexto et quinquagesimo' is
wrong. The simplest way. 1 think,
is to suppose that in the MSS. Vl.

This makes the reckoning right.
