36 DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE.

dierum numerum, ut nos, sed noctium computant. Sic
constituunt, sic condicunt: nox ducere diem videtur.
Illud ex libertate vitium, quod non simul nec ut jussi
conveniunt, sed et alter et tertius dies cunctatione co-
euntium absumitur. Ut turbae placuit, considunt armati.
Silentium per sacerdotes quibus tum et coercendi jus
est, imperatur. Mox rex vel princeps, prout aetas
cuique, prout nobilitas, prout decus bellorum, prout
facundia est, audiuntur, auctoritate suadendi magis
quam jubendi potestate. Si displicuit sententia, fremitu
aspernantur: sin placuit, frameas concutiunt. Honora-
tissimum assensus genus est, armis laudare.

XII. Licet apud concilium accusare quoque, et dis-
crimen capitis intendere. Distinetio poenarum ex delicto:
proditores et transfugas arboribus suspendunt: ignavos
et imbelles et corpore infames, coeno ac palude, injecta
insuper crate, mergunt. Diversitas supplicii illuc respicit,

Nec dierum] Caesen-(vi. 18) men-
tions the prevalence of the sanie
custom amongst the Gauls; and
gives their reason—a curious one—
for it, viz. that they were the pro-
gen)r of the infernal Dis: “Ob
eam eausam spatia omnis temporis
non numero dierum, sed noctium
finiunt3 dies natales et mensium
et annm um sic observant ut noctem
dies subsequatu1·.'' Our expressions,
‘se'nniglit‚' ‘fortnightf seem rem-
nanta of this eustom.

condicum] That is, instead of
fixing such and such a day, they fix
such and such a night. “ condictio '
was originally a term used for an
‘actio in personaiuJ because the
plaintiff gave the defendant notice
to appear on a given day, to choose
a judge. So ‘condicere coenam
alicui,¹ is to give a person notice
that you will sup with him (Cic.
Epist. ad Fani. i. 9). ‘Indico' is
used in the same way, but is said
to be an authoritative appoint-
ment; whereas ‘condicere' presup-

and for a similar custom amongst
the Gauls, compare Caesar, vii. ⁴21.

XII. intendere] The metaphor
seems to be that of stietching a. bow
to aim at any one; *intendere
arcum, sagittas,' δια, being com-
mon phrases.

supplicii] The original idea of
this word was that of a kneeling
posture⁷ assumed for the purpose of
entreaty, derived from ‘sub' and
‘ plico.' Hence ‘ supplicare' is equi-
valent to ‘flexibus genibus orare)
lt is used subsequently for any oc-
casion where this attitude would
be required, as, a. thanksgiving for
victory (Sall. Jug. 55), although
‘supplicatio' is the usual form in
this sense. It is also said by Festus
to designate the ‘ caduceus' or staff,
wreathcd round with fillets, borne
by messengers sent to negotiata
peare. (Sall. Jug. 46.) Then,

criminals was originally an act of
