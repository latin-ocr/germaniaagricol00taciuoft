(Book VII„ c. 1.)

Next after the Kelts, Germans occupy the districts beyond
the Rhine eastwards‚ differing only slightly from the Keltic racc,
in their greater ferocity, size, and yellowness of hair, but in all
other respect& in form, and habits, and way of life, resembling
the Kelts previously described. It is not then without reason.
I think, that the Romans gave them their name, intending by it
to designate them as genuine Gauls ; for in the language of Rome
the (ἔω-1113116 are by their name marked out as ‘⁶ genuinc.'’ The
first division of the country embraces the parts adjacent to the
Rhine from its source to its e1nbouchure3 and this river-valley

inhabitants of this, some have been removed by the Romans to
Keltica, others have taken the precaution to retire into the

and a part of the Sugambri. Next to the occupiers of this valley

the former, traversing a district of no less extent. Between

ridge continuous with the Alps, stretching eastward like a spur

of the Alps3 and indeed some have so described it, on account -

although of course the chain is not so elevated. Here also is
the Hercynian forest, and the peoples of the Suevi, partly situated
within the forest, as are the tribes of the Quadi. Amongst
these last is Buiaemu1n‚ the royal abode of Marobudus, to which
place he transplanted the Marcomani, akindred tribe, with many
others. For after his return from Rome, he raised himself
