consulibus. Quod si habitum quoque ejus posteri nos-
cere velint, decentior quam sublimior fuit: nihil metus
in vultu: gratia oris supererat: bonum virum facile ere-
deres‚ magnum libenter: Et ipse quidem, quanquam
medio in spatio integrae aetatis ereptus, quantum ad
gloriam, longissimum aevum peregit. Quippe et vera
bona, quae in virtutibus sita sunt, impleverat3 et consula-

potest videri etiam beatus, incolumi dignitate, florente
fama, salvis adfinitatibus et amicitiis, futura effugisse.
Nam sicuti durare in hac beatissimi seculi luce ac prin-
cipem Trajanum videre, quod augurio votisque apud
nostras aures ominabatur: ita festinatae mortis grande

Septembres,' or ⁸ Septembris: where
⁴ Septembris' is an adjective in the
accusative plural, not the genitive of
a noun, as is clear from comparing
the expression ‘ tertium nonas Janu-
arias' (H. i. 57). The ‘ante' in this
form seems to belong to ‘ Kalendas,'
and ‘decimum' is either the accu-
sative of time, or the accusative from
a sort of euphony after ⁸ antes This
‘ante' is often omitted as here, and
the day put in the ablative. ⁸ Decimo
Kalendarum' is also a: recognized
form.

Collega Priscoque consulibus] The
usual way would be to mention the
consuls by two names, with no par—
ticle or ‘et' between them. Here
Tacitus seems rather to add these
words by the way, than to introduce
them as a formal method of iden-
tifying the particular year. That
already has been done by stating
Agricola's age.

decentior] ⁴ rather comely,' ‘sym-
metrical, than tall of stature.'

nihil metus in vultu] ‘there was
nothing in his looks to inspire terror;
rather sweetness of expression, abun-

Also, H. i. 51, ‘ Arma, viri, equi ad
usum, et ad decus supererant?
medio in spatio eje] This does
not mean that he only lived half his
time, as some of the commentatore
think, but that he died in the midst
of his career, with the vigorous
powers of life undiminished. Cf.
Suet. Tiber. 10, “Integra aetate ac
valetudine statuit repente secedere
seque e medio longissime amovere.”
speciosae eontz'yerant] Dion Cas-
sius remarks that Agricola, after his
return from Britain, lived in neglect
and want. The assertion is directly
contradicted by this passage, and the
general tenor of the sixti· chapter.
Agricola had wealth enough to make
a respectable figure (speciosae).
sicuti durare in Ιιαε QG] In the
first part of this sentence supply
‘grande solatium suisset? ‘As it
would have been a great comfort to
prolong his life under ...... a fact
which he often foreshadowed in our
hearing in prediction and hope3 so
it was a great comfort* &c.
per intervalla ξε] “ No longer
