154. AGRICOLAE VITA.

bitus et crines in captivorum speciem formarentur: at
nunc veram magnamque victoriam, tot milibus hostium
eaesis, ingenti fama celebrari. Id sibi maxime formido-
losum, privati hominis nomen supra principis attolli:
frustra studia fori, et civilium artium decus in silentium
acta, si militarem gloriam alius occuparet: et cetera.⁴
utcunque facilius dissimulari, ducis boni imperatoriam
virtutem esse. Talibus curis exercitus, quodque saevae
cogitationis indicium erat, secreto suo satiatus, optimum
in praesentia statuit reponere odium, donec impetus
famae et favor ex'ercitu‘s languesceret: nam etiam tum
Agricola Britanniam obtinebat.

triumphum egit.'’ Caligula was
reduced to make his Germane on
the spot by similar means to those
mentioned here. Suet. Calig. 47,
“Transfugas barbaros coegit non
tantum rutilare et submittere co-
mam, sed et sermonem Germani-
cum addiscere et nomina barbarica
ferre.''

utcunque facilius] This word
‘utcunque' is used chiefly in two
senses. It means ⁸in whatever
way :³ ‘utcunque se ea res habuit,'
A. i. 5. Cf. Liv. xxxii. 3, “Sed
utcunque seu injuncta, seu suscepta
foret militia et eam exhaustam esse,''
διε. Besides this, it is used like
an adverb, in the sense of ‘some-
how or other.' Cf. A. xii. 51,
“Sed conjux gravida primam ut-
cunque fugam toleravit ;'' ¹ she made
shift to endure it somehow or
othe1·.' A. ii. 14, “primam ut-
cunque aciem hastatam ceteris prae-
usta aut brevia tela.'' This last
does not seem a Ciceronian use, but
is found in Livy, Tacitus, Pliny,
and later writers. Livy (xxix.l.5) has
“tempus esse . . . quae dubiis in
rebus utcunque tolerata essent, ea‚''
διο. Ι think here it means ‘other

may conceal certain qualities in a
variety of ways; and whichever of
these a man adopt, the concealment
is easier than that of military gloryg
that cannot be hidden, and marks
its possessor as a fit aspirant to the
imperial throne (² imperatoriam').
secreto] ‘gorging himself, as it
were, with his own solitary brooding.'
XL. triumphalia ornamenta] Un-
der the emperors, aster B.c. 14, the
actual triumph was their privilege,
as generalissimos of the armies of the
empire, and therefore the possessor-s
of the ⁴ auspicia? The ‘legati,' in
real command, were only allowed
the empty insignia of the triumph.
They were permitted to receive the
titles bestowed on the Imperatores
of the Republic; to appear in the
garb worn by them, a gold embroi-
dered dress (⁸ toga picta'), and
flowered tunic (⁴ tunica palmeata'),
and a crown of laurel. They also
were allowed to hand down to their
descendants the laurel-wreathed
statue, in a triumphal car, or to
have them erected in the city. This
statue is here called ‘ inlustris,'
elsewhere ‘laureata' (A. iv. 23),
and ‘ triumphalis ⁹ (A. xv. 72).
