sive adiit Hercules, seu quidquid ubique magnificum est,

atque in Herculem inquiri. Mox nemo tentavit: sanc-

Tam immensum terrarum spatium non tenent tantum
Chauci, sed et implent: populus inter Germanos nobilis-
simus, quique magnitudinem suam malit justitia tueri:
sine cupiditate, sine impotentia, quieti secretique, nulla

XXXV. In Seplemlrionem] By
this Tacitus means that the line of
coast, after a huge sweep to the
North, returns to its old direction.
He thus describes the Peniusula of
Denuiark. Pomponius Mela uses
very siniilarlanguage (iii. 3),ι cur-

Chauci] These people were neigh-
bours of the Frisii on the East, and
lived between the Enis and the
Elbc, in Oldenburg and Hanover.
The Weser dividcd them into Ma-

an account os them tot illy at vari ince
with the description of Tacitus,

speaking of them as a. miserable,
half-drowned race. Probably his
account was only true of the dwellers
in the fen portion of the district, and
not of those who lived further in-
land. In Beowulf they are men-
tioned apparently under the name of
HocingaiS‚ another instance of the
change from ‘ch' to ⁴h3' as in
