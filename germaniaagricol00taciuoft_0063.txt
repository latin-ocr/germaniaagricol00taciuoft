not score off against my account a
sham kindness.' “Fructus ami-
citiae magnae cieus3 imputat bunc
rex, Et quamvis rarum tamen im-
putat '' (Juv. v. 14): he makes
a merit of the rare dinner he aske
the client to. ⁶· lmputare perfidiam
non possunt qui Vitellium Vespa-
siano prodidvre, cum a Galba dc-
ccivissent'' (H. iii. 86) ς they could
hardly make a merit of their betrayal
of Vitellius to Vespasian. after pre-
viously revolting from Galba.

Victus inter lmspz'les] Many of
the editors propose to eject these
words as corrupt, or interpolated.
I do not see any necessity for ihis, as
they seem to contrast the behaviour
of the Germans towards strangers
who are sharing their hospitality
with their conduct when frivmls
only are present. In the former
case quietness and courtesy prevai13
in the latter quarrelling is sure to
arise.

XXII. plerumque] There is an
old adjective ‘plerus' in Latin
(cic. de Leg. iii. 3), of which this
is the neuter3 and the ‘que' is
apparently enclitic‚ found also in
‘quandoqne,' ‘denique‚' and other
words. This enclitic was probably
once an indefinite pronmm, eon-
neeted in origin and meaning with
the Greek τε (compare the form
ὅκκα for ὅτε, &C.). In a primitive
state of the language these indefinite
pronouns were placed, it aeetae, one
in each clause. In course of time
one of these was omitted, and the
remaining particle became a mere
copulative. Such words as ‘ple-
rumque,' ὅστε, &c., appear to pre-
sent vestiges of an intel-mediate

state of the lauguage, before the
change was entirely effected.

lavantur, saepius calida] Of the
verb ‘lavor' there is an active form
‘lavo‚' as in Terence, And. iii.
⁶2. 3‚⁴Nunc primum fac istaec ut
lavet.’ According to Varro (De
Lingua Lat. viii. (il) there is a dif-
fereuce between ¹ lavo ¹ and · lavor ;'
the former meaning to wash parts
of the body, the latter the whole,
aud used therefore in the sense of
taking a bath. I do not think
however that this difference really
existe. The use of ‘lavo' for
‘ lavor' seems equivalent to ‘moveo'
for ‘ moveor ς’ the pronoun properly
following the active forms bein
often omitted from the natural
tendeucy towards abbneviation. The
use of the bath is5 Ilwheve, com-
monly alluded to in the Nox-se Sagas3
and in Icelandie houses there was
usually a bath-mom, near the en-
tranee⁷ in which the inuiates often
took warm baths. In the Scandi-
navian idioms of the present (lay
Saturday is always teimed ‘liirdag,'
{loyerdagss or the like, implyiug the
at da .

calidi] This is used absolutely
for hot water. with the ellipse of
‘aqua.' So Juv. v. 63, “Quando
rogatus adest calidae gelidaeque
minister;'' and Pliny (Epist. iii.
5) has ‘frigida lavari.'

sua cuique mensa] This was con-
trary to the usual custom of the
Romans. amongst whom three. or
occasionally four guests, re‹·lined
on each of the ‘triclinia,' which
surrounded the table on three sides.
Sometimes however two or three
had a table between them.
