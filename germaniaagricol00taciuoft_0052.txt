aud 422 H. i. 15; A. i. 56. It is
a. form chiefly adopted by the writers
of the silvei· age, instead of the other
turns ‘mos 051,1 ‘in more ests &c.,
used by the Augustam writers.

suffiwturnm] This ellipse of the
pronoun ‘'se before 1110 future infi-
nitive is common in Taci1us30f.
A. i. 7· 1.·8 i. 35. Als obeforethe

principis' means the favourable con-
sideration of his chief (cf. Suet.
Calig g. 2.4 for this use of the word).
But there seem to me serious ob-
jections to this. and 1 think the first
impression on reading the passage is
