52 DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE.

voluptas spectantium. Aleam (quod mirere) sobrii inter
seria exercent, tanta lucrandi perdendive temeritate, ut,
cum omnia defecerunt, extremo ac novissimo jactu de
libertate et de corpore contendant. Victus voluntariam
servitutem adit: quamvis junior, quamvis robustior,
alligari se ac venire patitur. Ea est in re prava pervica-
cia: ipsi fidem vocant. Servos conditionis hujus per
commercia tradunt, ut se quoque pudore victoriae exsol-
vant.

XXV. Ceteris servis, non, in nostrum morem, de-
scriptis per familiam ministeriis, utuntur. Suam quisque
sedem, suos penates regit. Frumenti modum dominus
aut peeoris aut vestis, ut colono, injungit: et servus
hactenus paret. Cetera domus officia uxor ae liberi

sense it is generally by the best
writers joined to the subjunctive
mood, ‘quanquam' taking the in—
dicative. probably because the for-
mer word expresses a limitation
rather as a matter of conception in
the mind of another, than of actual
fact, like the latter. This rule
however is disreqarded by Tacitus,
who in fact sometimes just reverses it.

quod mirere] Not so much after
all to wonder αις for gaming being
“an euchanting witchery gotten
between idleness and marines is
almost nniversally prevalent amongst
savages, where the time unm-cupied
by the chase or war hange heavily
on their hands.

eoetv‘etrzo αο novissimo] The former
of these words conveys the idea of
being the end osa series z the throw
is a finishing one} ‘Novissinius'
implies that it is a desperate throw,
the man having nothing further to
stake. A throw might therefore be
‘extremus,’ and yet not ‘novis-
simus?

XXV. descriptis per familiam
{a} The great difference between
tse mass of Greek and Roman
slaves, and the slaves mentioned
in this chapter, consists in this,
'that the former were absolutely at
the disposal of the master, as much

as a negro is in the slave-hold-
ing Southeru States of Amerina,
whereas the latter were ‘glebae
adsc1·ipti,' attached to the soil.
The Thessalian ‘ Penestae‚' and La-
conian ‘ Helots‚‘ were on much the
same footing3 and a similar class
of serfs exists now in Russia, and
did exist until a com aratively
recent date in France. T e serf of
this description is bound to the soil
on which he is born. He can be
sold or let with it, but not away
from it, at least, not without his
consent, and is compelled to work
so many days a week for his master.
The ⁴ villeins' ofthe middle agesvvere
very much probably like the slaves
here spoken of by Tacitus. After·-

wards the Germans began to have ,

personal slaves3 and these praedial
serfs were distinguished by the name
of ⁶ lidi? The extent of the division
of duties amongst the Roman per-
sonal slaves of 'a household may be
inferred from the variety of names
used to designate their offioes, such
as ‘pistoresff ‘coqui,‘ ‘dulciarii‚'
‘ salmentarii: &c.
Ἰ quisque] That is, of course, each

Cetera domus] 1 do not see the
difficulty some commentators find
in these words. The serf provides
