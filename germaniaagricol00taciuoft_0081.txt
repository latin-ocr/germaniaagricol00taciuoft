DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE. 67
provocant bella, nullis raptibus aut latrociniis populan-
tur. Id praecipuum virtutis ac virium argumentum est,
quod, ut superiores agant, non per injurias assequun-

exercitus: plurimum virorum equorumque: et quies-

impotentes et validos falso quiescas: ubi manu agitur,

in which the word is generally used
by the Augustan writers. For in-
stance, Liv. xxiii. 8, “ubi in secre-
tum (hortus erat posticis aedium
partibus) pervenerunt.'' For this
meaning in Tacitus sec H. i. 1ος
Agric. 38. The serond meaning is
‘secret' in our sense of the word;
cf. A. iv. 7, “secreta quoque ejus
corrupta uxore prodebantur.'' This
use of the word is rare in the best
writers, but frequent in Tacitus and
his contemporaries.

plurimum] Tacitus seems to have
added these words by way of ex-
plaining what he meant by ‘ exer-
citus.' Some of the German tribes
were pou-ertu] in infantry, like the
Chatti; others in cavalry as the Ba-
tavi and Tencteri ·, the Chauci how-
ever possessed both in great num—
bers.

XXXVI. Cherusci] This people
——to he distinguished from the Che-
tuscan league. which contained other
nations as well—appears to have
occupied a. tract bounded by the
Weser on the West. and the Elbe in
the East, and reaching from Mons
Meliboeus in the North as far as the
Sudeti in the Sonth. Their locality
was therefore the modern Luneburg‚
Brunswick, Magdeburg, διο. They
were on good terme with the Romans
until the conduct of Varus roused
them to rebellion, and they formed

a leagne of their neighbours, the
Dulgibini. Chasuarii, dcc.. and totally
defeated Varus and his three legions
near the Saltus Teutobcreiensis, un-
der the command of Arminius, ΑΛ).
9. Germanicus endeavoured with no
great success to reduce them, and it
was only in consequence of intemal
dissensions that the Chatti overcame
them, so that Ptolemy only knew
thern as a small tribe South of the
Har-1„ mountains. They appear aster-
wardsin the great Frank confederacy.
WVhen Tacitus desciibes them aa
being in ⁴ latere Chaucorum Chatto-
rumque‚' he means that they are on
the Eastern frontier of those tribes.

jucundius quum nnius] This duu-
ble comparative is both a Greek and
a Latin idiom, whereas ours requires
one os the adjectivcs to be in the
positive. It seems easily accounted
sor. Turn the sentence in this way,—
of two courses it was the plcasanter,
rather than the safer.

qui olim lumi ἅρ] Tacitus does
not mean that ani· deterioration took
place in the Cherusci : the only
change was in their circumstances.
They were once powerful. and then
their peace—ful tendcncy appeared tho
result of moderation and justice.
*When their power was gone, this
forbearance was regarded as a proof
of weakness and onwan-dive. ‘Tho
Chatti were more lucky z they were
