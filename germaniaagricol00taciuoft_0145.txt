XX. Haec primo statim anno comprimendo, egregiam
famam paci circumdedit: quae vel incuria vel intolerantia

does not necessarily seem any zeugma
here. ‘ Commodare' is used by the
writers of the age of Tacitus very
much in the sense of giving, as-
siguing‚-a meaning which suits
the first clause as well as the
second.

clausis horreis {a} This is a very
difficult passage, of which I think
the explanation is as follows: The
corn was the ‘frumentum in cel-
lam' or ‘aestimatum,' provided by
the provincials at a fixed rate for·
the use of the governor and troops.
This the Britons would have sup-
lied easily, if the Roman agents
had not first secured in some way
or other all the corn in any given
neighbourhood, and stored it in
their own granaries, kept closed
(‘ clausis horreis'). XVhen the Bri—
tons had to supply the corn, there
was none forthcoming, except from
the Roman stores. Consequently‚
they were forced to buy their· corn
at the Roman granaries, subjected
during the negotiation to all kinds
of insults, the granaries being open
only at stated times (adsidere per
ludibrium ⁹). The Britons were
moreover compelled to pay an
enormous price for their corn, being
made to bid one against the other,
to run up thevalue (⁶ ludere pretio').
After purchasing it, they had to
resell it to the Romans, as ‘fru-

mentum aestimatum,' at the low
fixed price.

Besidcs this there was a second
wrong done them. They were or-
dered to supply the corn at some
distant quar-ter: to avoid the enor-
mous expense and difficulty of
transit, they found themselves com-
pelled to buy com in the manner
stated in the locality where it had
to be supplied to the government.

ut civitates . . . in remota eju]
Cicero accuses Verres (iii. 82) of
the same thing: “ Avarior-es magis-
tratus instituerunt semper in ultima
ac difficillima ad portandum loca
frumentum imperare, ut vecturae
difficultate ad quam vellent aesti-
mationem pervenirent.” This pro-
ceeding, however, was not actually
illegal, as the magistrates were al-
lowed to fix the place where the
corn was to be delivered.

uod omnibus in promptu effa]
‘T at of which there was really
abundance at hand (if they had been
allowed to arrange the matter fairly),
was turned into a source of gain to
a few (Roman officials).'

XX. famam paci circumdedit] A
similar phrase occurs H. iv. ll,
‘⁶ Qui principatus inanem ei famam
circumdarent 3³³ and in the dialogus
de Orat. 37, “ Hanc illi famam cir-
cumdederunt.” It seems an imi-

tation of the Greek: Μὴ πρὸς
