gXLV. obsessam curiam] This is
not mentioned elsewhere. Nero, to
secure the condemnation of Thrasea,
once posted Praetorian cohorts round
the temple of Venus, where the
senate met. and guarded the approach
with ciyilians armed with swords
openly displayed. Domitian may
very likely have done the same
thiu .

τοίἔ consularium caedes] A list of
Domitiam victims is found in Suet.

death on the most trivia] charges.

seminarum exsilia] Fannia,
wife of Helvidius Priscus, was ba-
nished by Domitianus for inducing
Herennius Senecio to write her late
husband's life. Gratilla, wife of
Arulenus Rusticus, and Arria, wife
of iI'hrasea„ were also in the list of

Carus illelius censebatur] ‘ Cen-
seri' means ‘to be rated at? Cf.
Juv. viii. 2, ‘longo sanguine cen-
seri,' ‘to be valued, rated at. long
descent? This Metius is mentioned
with Massa Bebius in Juv. i. 35, 36
as the prince of informers. He
seems to have been the man who
brought Senecio to trial for writing
the life of Helvidius Priscus, and
entertained thoughts of accusing
Pliny the Younger. The pair of
worthies were themselves brought to

trial by Heliodorus, and put to
death (Schol. on Juv. i. 35).

Alassa Bebz'us] He was a pro-
curator in Africa in A.D. 70, and de-
scribed by Tacitus (H. iv, 50) as
