DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE. 39
gloria est, si numero ac virtute comitatus emineat: ex-
petuntur enim legationibus, et muneribus ornantur, et
ipsa plerumque fama bella profligant.

XIV. Cum ventum in aciem, turpe principi virtute
vinci; turpe comitatui virtutem principis nou adaequare.
Jam vero infame in omnem vitam ac probrosum, super-
stitem principi suo ex acie recessisse. Illum defendere,
tueri, sua quoque fortia facta gloriae ejus adsignare, prae-
cipuum sacramentum est. Principes pro victoria pug-
nant: comites pro principe. Si civitas, in qua orti sunt,
longa pace et otio torpeat, plerique nobilium adolescen-
tium petunt ultro eas nationes, quae tum bellum aliquod
gerunt; quia et ingrata genti quies, et facilius inter
ancipitia clarescunt, magnumque comitatum non nisi vi
belloque tueare: exigunt enim principis sui liberalitate

erpetuntur quationibus] This by certain of them refused to survive

means that when embassies are sent
to the state to which these illustrious
chiefs belong, the ambassadors apply
to them, and make-them presents, in
the hope of obtaining their co-ope-
ration.

bella prqflioant] Cf. Liv. xxi.
40, “ Deos ipsos committere ac pro-
fligare bellum, nos commissum ac
profligatum conficere.'' ⁴ Profligare'
seems to mean, to deal a blow that
sets any thing tottering, or first gives
it an effective check ς and ‘ profligare
bellum' is to break the back of a
war, as we say-3 so that the subse-
quent couiplction of it is an easy
matter.

XIV. infame. . . ac probrosum] The
former implies that the act tarnished
the character of any one who was
guilty of it; the latter that it ex-

osed him to the reproaches of others.

his was only true with reference to
the desei-tion of the ‘ princeps' by
his ‘comites3' as for the mass of
the fighting men, they were too in-
dependent to pay much regard to
their leaders. Compare A. ii. 14,
“sine pudore flagitii, sine cuia
ducum abire, fugere.'' Caesar (iii.
22) mentions a nearly similar point
of honour amongst the Gauls, where-

the friends with whoni they were
connected by ties of conipanionship.

dqunderc, tueri] The former only
implies, to ward off actual danger in
battle; the latter, generally to pro-
tect his interests.

sacramentmn] This was strictly
the oath voluntarily taken by the
early Roman soldiers, not to desert„
quit the ranks, ἀεὶ. The involuntary
oath which they were cmnpelled,
after Bc. 216, to take by the ‘tri-
buni niilituui' was properly called
‘jusjuranffiuuff Livy (xxii. 38) ‹lis-
tiuguishes the two: ⁸ jurejurando ab
tribunis militum adacti . . . . naui ad
eam diem nihi] praeter sacramentum
fuerat.''

petunt ultro] This was the same
plan as that pursued in after times
by the Free Conipanics, and Con-
dottieri, of the Middle Ages, who
took service as solalicrs of fortune
under any prince who offered to pay
sor their services.

tueare] {for this use of the second
person singular compare ll. i. l,
“sed ambitionem scriptoris facile
averseris ;“’ Α. ii. 302 iii. 542 vi. 8;
and observe that this termination in
‘re,' instead of ‘ris,' is the usual
one.
