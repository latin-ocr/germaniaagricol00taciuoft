DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE. 33
Suevorum et Isidi sacrificat. Unde causa et origo pere-
grino sacro parum comperi, nisi quod signum ipsum in
modum liburnae figuratum, docet advectam religionem.
Ceterum, nec cohibere parietibus deos neque in ullam
humani oris speciem assimilare, ex magnitudine coeles-
tium arbitrantur: lucos ac nemora consecrant, deorumque
nominibus appellant secretum illud quod sola reverentia
vident.

X. Auspicia sortesque, ut qui maxime, observant.
Sortium consuetudo simplex: virgam, frugiferae arbori

the victors devoted the entire army H. v. 5, where, in his account of
of the vanquished in sacrifice to the Jews, he says, “Judaei mente

the gods.

Isidi]
Mythologie, p. 188, sug-:ests that
Isis may represent a goddess Zisa,

Grimm, in his Deutsche

or Cisa, whose mernory had sur- . .

vived so late as the thirteenth
century, about Augsburg. If so,
the name decided the identity. Ι
am more inclined ·to agree with
Ritter‚ that the goddess was the
Mother Hertha, alluded to in c. 40.
The ‘liburna' here, and the ‘vehi—
culum' there, were probably the
same, the ship being put on wheels,
and rolled along. There is mention,
about A.D. 1130, of a procession
formed hythe people of the Lower
Rhine, in which a ship was put on
wheels, and rolled from Tongres to
Louvain. It seems alm, that early
in March, on the opening of navi-
gation, a boat was offered to Isis at
Rome3 and Pelagia was one of her
Greek sumames. This coincidence
of the boat very likely, I think,
determined the identity of the two
goddesses in Tacitus⁸s view.

nec cohibere parietibus eje] Ta-
citus elsewhere mentions temples.
For instance, in A. i. 51, he
speaks of “ celeberrimum illis gen-
tibus templum qnod Tanfanae vo-
cabant‚'' amongst the Marsi; bnt
he probably only means by it a
sacred enclosure, or grove. With
the whole of this account of the
religion of the Germans, compare

sola, unumque numen intelligunt:
profanos qui deum imagines mor-
talibus materiis in species hominum
affingant. Igitur nulla. simulacra
. . templis sinunt.''
lucos ae nemora] ⁸ Lucus' is always
used for a grove, consecrated to the
gods, and so differs from ‘nemus'
For a description of one of these
groves, see Lucan iii. 415, διο.
secretum illud ega] ‘ secretum·
does not mean the retirement os the
grove, but the abstract idea they
formed in their imagination of the
deity. According to the different
aspccts under which this idea pre-
sented itself, the names of the gods
varied.

X. ut qui maxime] The full
sentence would be, ‘observant ut
ii qui maxime observant! A simi-
larly elliptical expression is ‘cum
maxime?
tantem cum maxime conjurationem
disjecit;'’ i.e. “coeptaiitcui, cum
maxime coeptaret.''

vz'ryam, fivqfffhrae csta] Some-
thing like this is mentioned by
Herodotus (iv. (ἱῖ) as practised
amongst the Scythians. 'l'he Alani
too are said to have collected bun-
dles of twigs, and letting them fall
with incantations, from the posi-
tion they took to have divined the
future.

notis quibusdam] According to
some these were Runic chan-actem
