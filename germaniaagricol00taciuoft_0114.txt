AGRICOLAE VITA.

excusatus.

IV. Gnaeus Julius Agricola, veteri et inlustri Foro-
juliensium colonia ortus, utrumque avum procuratorem

sapientiaeque notus, iisque virtutibus iram Caii Caesaris

meritus.

historic work. It is like Virgil's
phrase, ‘ olim et hacc meminisse
juvabit* Compare also Livy's re-
mark in his preface. ⁴ Juvabit tamen
ro virili et ipsum consuluisse!
Vex, by some refinements of argu-
ment Ι do not understand, objects
to this, and makes “composuisse'
equivalent to a Greek aorist, like
συνθεῖναι, συγγράψαι, &c.‚ to de-
note the single act of composing‚
without regard to time. To my
mind the other is a. very much better
explanation.

pietatis] Cf. Cic. pro Plancio 33,
“ Quid est pietas nisi grata voluntas
in parentes Ρ “’

IV. Gnaeus Julius Αῃνὶεοῖα]
The general custom of Tacitus in
citing names is to use two.. the
‘gentile' and ‘cognomen‚' on the
first mention (unless the person be
extraordinarily illustrious, like the
Caesars, or—extremes meeting—
very obscure), and the single name
afterwards, Ritter sets himself to
rectify all cases unt harmonizing
with the rule (A. xiii. 30), thereby,
in order to make the theory square
well, taking unwarrantable liberties
with thc text. lt is more .1ikely‚
I think, that in a long work, Ta—
citus was not always consistent.
Here, at all events. one can easily
see why the historian gave Agricola's
full name, as he is the subject of
the present biographical memoir.

ΓΓΟντζῘιιῖιὶήικ-ἱιιιη colonia] This
place is the modern Frejus, on the
coast between Toulon and the Var,

no reat distance from Nice. Pro-
bab y it derived its name from
Julius Caesar, as it was a naval
station in the reign of his successor
(H. iii. 43). Octavius sent to it
the ships he took at Actium.

procuratorem] The Procuratores
managed the imperial ‘patrimo-
nium,' and also all the business
connected with the revenues of the
imperial provinces, as distinguished
from the Quaestors in the senatorial
provinces. In some of the less im-
portant provinces the Procuratores
were sole governorS.

quae equestris nobilitas est] ‘A
dignity peculiar to the knights.’
Emperors like Claudius made Pro-
curatores even of their freedmen;
but this was a violation of the usual
arrangement.

Julius Graecinus] This is the
man of whom Seneca (de Benef.
ii. 21) says, “Si exemplo magni
animi opus est. utamur Graecini
Julii. vim' egregii quem C. Caesar
occidit ob hoc unum quod melior
vir esset quam esse quenquam
tyranno expediret.” It was his
refusal to accuse Silanus that drew
on him the resentment of Caligula,
who seized probably the first fair
pgegext he could find for getting n'd
o im.

illan-um Silanum] This Silanus
was consul in ΑΛ). 19: his daughter,
Ap. 33, married Caligula, in whose
reign he was Proconsul of Africa.
The emperor, being jealous of
him, deprived him of power, and.
