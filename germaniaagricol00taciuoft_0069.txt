DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE. 55
Arva per annos mutant3 et superest ager: nee enim cum
ubertate et amplitudine soli labore contendunt, ut po-
maria conserant et prata separent et hortos rigent: sola
terrae seges imperatur. Unde annum quoque ipsum non
in totidem digerunt species: hiems et ver et aestas in-
tellectum ac voeabula habent: autumni perinde nomen
ac bona ignorantur.

XXVII. Funerum nulla ambitio: id solum obser-
vatur, ut corpora clarorum virorum certis lignis eremen-
tur. struem rogi neo vestibus nee odoribus cumulant:
sua cuique arma, quorundam igni et equus adjicitur.

‘They apportion land to form vil-
lages, and ' ἃς.

Arva per annos mutant] ‘ Arvum '
is used here in its proper sense, of
arable land3 and the words do not
imply that the occupants of the soil
differ every year, but that what is
arable one year, becomes fallow the
next, and vice versa.. It could not
mean the former, because corn was
their only produce ς and as there was
no system of rotation, the soil could
not bear successive erops, but had
to lie fallow in alternate years.

With regard to the whole of the
account here given, oue can scarcely
think this apparently entire absence
of private property in land likely.
can it be that Tacitus's account is
only a repetition of Caesar's, or a
general inference drawn by him
from what Caesar may have known
to occur in the case of the occupa-
tion by Germans of some dispos-
sessed Gallie tri bes?-—an assumption,
in fact, that what may have been
only a temporary expedient was the
universal custom of the Τ eutonie
race.

non in totidem] That is. as many
as we do. They grow only corn;
and winter, spring, and summer
completing this department of hus-
bandry, they have no name for
autumn, the great time for fruit
crops. There is even now in English
no word of home growth to de-
signate this part of the year;

autumn of course being of Latin
orlffln.

XXVII. crementur] There seem
to have been two periods, tolerably
well separated from each other,
amongst Teutonic natione, during
which burning and burying the dead
respectively prevailed. The former
method existed, according to this
passage, at all events as late as
the time of Tacitus, Amongst the
Romans this order was just re-
versed3 burial having been the
primitive custom, and buining the
later one. Pliny (vii. 55) gives
the reason: “Ipsum cremare apud
Romanos non fuit veteris instituti3
terra condebantur, at postquam
longinquis bellis obrutos erui cog—
novere institutum.” Even when
burning the dead was a general
eustoni, some old families retained
the practice of burial.

vestibus] Lucan (ix. 175), in a
description of the honours paid to
Pompeius Magnus by Cornelia,
mentions this point in the Roman
usage,—

“ Collegit vestes miserique insignia
Magni,
Armaque et impressas auro, quas
gesserat olim,
Exuvias, pictasque togas3 vela-
mina summo
Ter conspecta Jovi, funestoque
intulit igni.''

sua cuique arma] This practice
