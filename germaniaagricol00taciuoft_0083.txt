joins one word to another as an ap-
pendage to it, or belonging to it so
closely as often to form only one
complex notion. Consequently 'et'
is here the likeliest rendnw, when it
is mentioned that two people, in the
way of addition, were Consuls. and
no further relation between them is
pointed out.

Ea· quo lje] This date was Rc.
113, in which year the Cimbri were
first heard of in Noricum. Hem-e
they descended in'to Illyricum, and
at the foot ot' the Raetian Alps
totally defeated Car bo.

tamdiu . . . vimieur] This use
ofa present tense with a partit-le of
time is common enough. It points
out thedurationofthe far-t mentioned
for a long time past. and its contiuu-
ance at the present moment. Taci-
tus means to say that Germany has
been long in conquering, and the
conquest is not completed yet.

Hispaniae, Galliam-e] Many ofthe
Roman provinces were sub‹livi‹l‹·d
into two parts: there were Hispania
trans Iberum, and Hispania cis
Iberum: also Gallia Trans, and
cis Alpina.

rayno Arsacis] The original coun—
try of the Parthians was a tract wa-
tered by the Orhus at the South-
east extremity of the Caspian Sea.
It once formed the N orthern portion
of Alexander‘s empire. After his
death, Parthia was a province of the
kingdom ofthe Seleucidae. A bout Β c.
250, Aram-es, a man of obscure ori-
gin, shook off the yoke„ and totally
defeated Seleucus ll. (calinicus),
who attempted to reduce him to sub-

mission. He was consequently re-
garded as the founder of the Parthian
empireand those sovereigns after him
were called Arsarinlae. The remark
of Tacitus is equivalent to this, that
the Ger-maus, fighting in behalf of
liberty, were more vigorous oppo-
nents than the Parthians, who only
fought to maintain the power of their
royal house.

Crassi] In Rc. 54 Crassus set out
for Syria with an avowed intention
of penetrating, hke Alexander, to
the furthe-t hounds of the East.
After wintering in Svria, he ‹wssed
the Euphrates and plunged into the
plains of Mesopotamia under the
trent-herous guidam-e of Abgarus, an
Arab ehicfi After suffering great
losses from the Parthian attacks. he
was induced to meet their general in
an interview. and was treacherously
seized and in the fray that ensued
killed.

itgs'ra Ventidium] Ventidius Bas-
sus was a native of Picenum. taken
prisoner when young by tlu- Romans
in the Social war. After earning a
living by furnishing mules to magis-
nates un their way to the provinces,
he berame known to Caesar, and
rose in Bc. 43 to the rank of Praetor.
In Β c. 39 he was sent by Antonius
into Asia to oppose Labienus„ who ”
was supported by the Parthians.
When these last attackcd him he
defeated them near Mount 'l'anrus,
and gained possession of Syria. The
next year, Pacorus, son of Orodes
the Parthian king, advanced against
him, bnt was defeated in Cyrrhestica
and fell in battle. Pliny (vii 44)
quotes Ventidius as a remarkable
