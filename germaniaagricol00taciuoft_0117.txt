AGRICOLAE VITA. 103

more juverum, qui militiam in lasciviam vertunt, neque
segniter ad voluptates et commeatus, titulum tribunatus
et inscitiam rettulit: sed noscere provinciam, nosci ex-
ercitui, discere a peritis, sequi optimos, nihil appetere in
jactationem, nihil ob formidinem recusare, simulque et
anxius et intentus agere. Non sane alias exercitatior
magisque in ambiguo Britannia fuit: trucidati veterani,
incensae coloniae, intercepti exercitus: tum de salute,

mox de victoria certavere.

Quae cuncta etsi consiliis

ductuque alterius agebantur, ac summa rerum et re-

cuperatae provinciae gloria

the holders of this post, in spite of
their nominal rank, were really
ignorant, generally speaking, of a
soldier's duties‚ and regarded the
army—not without modern imi-
tators-as a convenient lounging-
place, Tacitus adds ‘et inscitiam?
⁴ Licenter' refers to ‘voluptates,'
‘segniter' to ‘commeatus' The
whole passage *means as follows:
‘Nor did Agricola, with a display
of disorderly licence, or idle loung-
ing, make his nominal tribuneship
and real ignorance a ground for
pleasurable indulgence, or repeated
surloughs.’

noscere provinciam] ‘ to acquaint
himself with provincial romine)
Tacitus often uses ‘ noscere ' in this
sense. Cf. H. i. 68, “ Helvetii . . .
non arma noscere, non ordines
sequi 3³⁵ which does not mean ‘to
be ignorant of the ‚use of arms,
but not to attend to driu, διε.
Compare also H. ii. 93, “miles urbe
tota. vagus non principia noscere,''
i. e. not to pay the usual regard to
the ‘ principia?

in tionem] Agricola did not
solicit dangerous duties with a view
to boast hereafter of his success.

simulque et anxius {a} Some of
the commentators ma e a difficulty
here, where there does not seem to
be one, in the use of‘simulque et
. . . . et? The sense is not, ‘ and
to act at once with due solicitude
and energy3' for then the ‘et'

in ducem cessit3 artem et

before ‘anxius' would be super·
fluous; but the ‘simulque' con-
nects ‘ agere' with ‘ recusare :⁵ ‘nihil
ob formidinem recusare, simulque
(and withal) agere (ita ut) et anxius
et intentus (esset).' (Jf the two
adjectives here, ‘anxins' refers to
the future, fearful of evcntnal mis-
carriage3 ‘intentus,' to the present,
with his whole energics bent to the
work in hand.

trucidati veterani, ἐξα] Tacitus
describes this outbreak in A. xiv.
31, διο. Ὗὴεῐι Suetonius Paulinus
was engaged in his expedition
against Mona, the Iceni, under Bou-
dicca, aided by the Trinobantes
and others, rose against the Ro-
mans. The Colonia Camulodunum,
and the Municipia Verulamium and
Londinium (all called loosely ‘co-
loniae' herc), were burnt. Petilius
Cerialis on haste-ning to the rescue
was defeated, his cavalry alone es·
caping. In the butt-hery attending
this outbreak 70‚000 'citizens and
allies perished. The ‘ veterani’ were
especially obnoxious to the Britons :
“Acerrimo in veteranos odio,
quippe in coloniam Camulodunum
recens deducti pellebant domibus,
exturbabant agris captivos, servos
appelland0.”

in ducem cessit] ‘fell to the
share of the. gencral.' For this
sense of the word, cf. H. i. ll,
‘ Inermes provinciae in pretium
victoriae cessurae erant3' and H.
