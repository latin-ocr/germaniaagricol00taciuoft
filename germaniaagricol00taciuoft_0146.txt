AGRICOLAE VITA.

priorum, haud minus quam bellum timebatur. Sed ubi
aestas advenit, contracto exercitu, multus in agmine, lau-
dare modestiam, disjectos coercere: loca castris ipse
capere, aestuaria ac silvas ipse praetentare: et nihil in-
terim apud hostes quietum pati, quominus subitis excur-
sibus popularetur: atque ubi satis terruerat, parcendo>
rursus inritamenta pacis ostentare. Quibus rebus multae
civitates, quae in illum diem ex aequo egerant, datis
obsidibus iram posuere, et praesidiis castellisque circum-
datae, tanta ratione curaque, ut nulla ante Britanniae

nova pars.

θεῶν μοι περιβάλῃς ἀνανδρίαν
(Orest. lO3l); and Ἐμοὶ δὲ ἀτι-
μίαν περιέθετε, Thucyd. vi. 89.

intolerantia] The word is here
used passively, as in Suetonius
(Tib. 51), ‘Acerbitate et intole-
rantia niorum‚' manners others
could not tolerate. Sometimes it
is used actively for the incapacity
to tolerate any thing3 as Cic. pro
Cluent. 40, “Quis enim cum illa
superbia atque intolerantia ferre
potuisset?''

multus in aymine] Sc. ‘esse.'
The phrase is use-d of any one who
shows himself frequently on the
line of march, first here, and then
there. Cf. Sall. Jug. 96, ⁸ In agmine
atque ad vigilias multus adesse.'
‘ Multus' is also used in the sense
of ‘vigorous;' cf. Sall. Jug. 84,
who copied the Greek use of πολύς,
in such phrases as πολὺν ἐνέκειτο,
πολὺς τοῖς συμβεβηκόσιν ἔγκειται,
ὅταν πολὺς ὁ θεὸς ἔλθῃ, &Q

loca castris ipse capere] Agricola
seems to have mat-ebed from Mona
through the WVestern side of England
to the Scottish berder, or, according
to some, to the Fr1th of Forth,
although the former seems more
likely. There are still traces of
Roman encampments visible along
the route Agricola apparently took
Northwards.

aestuaria] These estuaries would
be the Dee, Ribble, and Solway
Friths. By ‘aestuaria praetentare'

Tacitus means that Agricola ascer-
tained whether the estuat-ies were
fordable. Cf. A. ii. 8, '⁶' Prima
aestuaria nondum adcrescente unda
intrepidi transiere.''

quominus . . . popularetur] The
subject ofthe verb hereis ⁸ Agricola ς’
he gave them no rest from ravaging
their country. This is much better
than translating it, ⁴ he allowed the
enemy no rest, to prevent his laying
waste the Roman camp by sudden
inroads,' which makes it necessary
to supply ‘hostis' from ‘apud
hostes!

ea: aequo egerant] Cf. H. iv. 64,
“Integer, et servitutis oblitus o-
pulus, aut ex aequo agetis aut a iis
inipel'ubitis.” The states in question
had remained independent, and not
been conquered or enslaved by the
Romans..

utnulla ante ᾇτ’] The old edi-
tions read, ‘ut nulla ante Bri-
tanniae nova pars illacessita trans-
ie1·it‚' in which Ι do not, see any
sense. By ending with ‘ nova pars,'
and making ‘inlacessita transiit'
refer to the ‘sequens hiems,' the
passage becomes intelligible. The
only point unusual is the combina-
tion of‘ tanta . . . nt' in the sense
of ‘so great as.' Cicem, however,
has something of the sort: ‘⁶ Nun—
quam tamen neque tantum peri-
culum mihi adire visus sum neque
tanto opere pertimui ut nunc in
ipso judicio ;” and “Est alienum
