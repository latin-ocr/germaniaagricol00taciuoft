DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE. 73

· tuna Semnonum: centum

pagis habitant: magnoque

corpore efficitur, ut se Suevoruiu caput credant.
XL. Contra Langobardos paucitas nobilitat: plu-

mentioned, but was gathered into a

between Uebicgnu and Srlilieben, re-

knot on the crowu of the head3 but mains of vossi-is usi-d for sacrificial

this does not seem to have been a
fashion so prevalent a< the other.
From the passage of Juvenal one
would supnose there were some-
times several of these knots on the
man‘s head.

inno-riae] Tacitus means that,
although the Suevi are careful of
their appearance, and deck them-
selves out, they have no immoral
object in doing so. They do not
trin-k themselves out like Roman
Lotharios, to win the admiration
and love of the fair sex: it has
a war-like object, to terrify their
enemies.

XXXIX. Semnones] The seats of
this people probably extended from
the Rieseugebiige in ilie South, to
Frankfort on the Oder and Pois-
dam, occupyim: part of Mark Bran-
denburg, and the kingdom of
Saxony, Silesia, aud Anhalt. The
quantity of the penultiinate syllable
is doubts-113 Strabo and Ptolemy
spelling it with a long and short
vowel respectively.

Fides antiqnitalis] That is, ‘the
credibility of the antiquity they
claim is supported by the nature of
their religious cult? 1 suppose he
means that the very bai-barity of
the ceremony is a proof of the an-
tiquity of those who practise it.
A rite so awi'ul must have had its
origin in a time far removed from
the present, and bears on it the
stamp os a bygone age,—a remark
which might have weight if it were
a Roman custom he was descrifflng,
for they had been long more or less
civilized, but has none when applied
to the uncivilized Gennans.

in silvam] This is placed hy
wilhelm between the Elster and
the sprec, in the Finsterwald, or
Sonnenwald. In this neighbourhood,

purposes have been found.

auyuriis patrum] As the com—
mentators notice. this clause from
‘auguriis' to ‘sacrum' forms a
hexameter. They have collected at
least a dozen similar instances in
Tacitus, a dozen warninfgs to avoid
any thing of the kind in composi-
tion.

prisea] ‘ Priscus* generally has the
notion of primitive, old-fashioned,
attached to it. ln this respect it.
differs from ⁴ antiquus ' and ‘ vetus]
These last again differ in this
point, that ‘antiquus' is used to
express whatever existed before our
time; ‘vetus,' to denote uhat has
been long in existence. For in—
stance. ‘oppidum antiquum* is a
town that existed in our forefathers'
tirne; ‘ oppidum vetns,' a town that
has existed a long time back from
the present epovh. Howevcr‚ this
distinction is not always observed.

minor} Horace used the word in
a very similar sense (iii. 6. 5), ‘ Dis
te minorem nuod geris imperas?
and (i. 12. 57), ‘te minor latum
reget aequus 01·b-m.'

corpore] ‘Corpus' is used to
denote the aggregate association of
several bodies. Cf. A. xiii. 27.
‘late fusum id corpus (libertorum) ς’
and Η. iv. 6⁴, ⁴ rediisse vosin corpus
nomenque Germaniae.'

XL. Langsubscrdos] This tribe is
said to have come originally from
Scandinavin, as the winili, and to
have received their name from the
length of their beards. Another
view, and, in my opinion. a more
probable one, is that the word
‘ hard* is the sa'nie as the last syl-
lable of ⁴ halbert‚' and that the name
is derived fro-n the weapon they
carried. In their original locality
they occupied the tract called Bar-
