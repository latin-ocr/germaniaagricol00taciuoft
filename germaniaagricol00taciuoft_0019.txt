the magistrates and ehiefs every year assign to the various tribes
and families united together, a certain portion of land, the
extent and locality of which is lest to their discretiori. In
the following year they force them to remove elsewhere. For
this, various reasons are assigned 3 its object is either to provide
against the exchange of warlike pursuits for husbandry under
the charms of lengthened habituation to the soil3 or to prevent
the wish to acquire large possessiom, and the more powersul
from expelling the weaker from their holdings; or again, that
they may not build houses too carefully, to exclude cold and
heat3 lastly‚ to cheek the rise of desire for wealth, from which
party strife and factions spring3 in order the better to keep the
bulk of the populace in a contented frame of mind, when they
see their own resourees on a level with those of the most
powerful amongst them.

The highest boast of the states is to sui-round themselves with
the broadest possible wastes‚ hythe desolation of the country
beyond their frontiers. In their eyes it is the privilege of
superior bravery to eonipel their neighbours to retire from their
lands, while none venture to romain in their vicinity; and
besides, as all apprehension of sudden inroads is thus removed,
they regard it as conducive to greater security. When the state
is engaged in war, defensive or offensive‚ magistrates are chosen
to conduct it, with power os life and death. In times of peace
there is no magistrate for the whole tribe, but the chiess ot' the
districts and cantons administer justice and settle disputes
between their followers.

Acts of robbery committed beyond the frontiers of each state
involve no disgrace3 the object of these is stated to be the due
training of their youths, and the prevention of indolence. WVhen
any chieftain in the council offers to lead these excursions, and
bids those who choose to follow him, to give their names, all
who approve of the enterprise and the man, rise, and offer their
help, and are applauded by the crowd: all who decline to follow
are regarded in the light of deserters and traitors, and after this
all credit is withheld from them. To offer violence to guests is
considered a crime: all who visit them, no matter for what
reason, they protect from hat-m, and treat as sacred: every house
is open to them, and the meal is shared with them. v
