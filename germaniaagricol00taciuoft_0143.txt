AGRICOLAE VITA. 129
revocatum Paulinum rebellione totius Britanniae supra
memoravi, redigere in potestatem animo intendit. Sed, ut
in dubiis consiliis, naves deerant z ratio et constantia ducis
transvexit. Depositis omnibus sarcinis, lectissimos auxi-
liarium, quibus nota vada et patrius nandi usus, quo
simul seque et arma et equos regunt, ita repente im-
misit, ut obstupefacti hostes, qui classem, qui naves, qui
mare exspectabant, nihil arduum aut invictum credide-
rint sic ad bellum venientibus. Ita petita pace ac dedita
insula, clarus ac magnus haberi Agricola, quippe cui
ingredienti provinciam, quod tempus alii per ostenta-
tionem aut officiorum ambitum transigunt, labor et peri-
culum placuisset. Nec Agricola, prosperitate rerum in
vanitatem usuS, expeditionem aut victoriam vocabat,

ιέῖζὲἱξῗεεθέῗῖἕέἶοέἶῗῗῗέῖῗ ³115ssstss
preposition, ‘a' or ‘ab.³ Tacitus
omits the preposition, as he does
in the case of verbs compounded of
‘re‚' like ‘renvearess when followed
by a noun of place: ‘remearis
Syria,' &c. In these two respects he
follows poetical usage, copying Vir—
gil's ‘ Acie revocaveris ambo,' and
Horace‘s ‘retortis littore Etrusco
violenter undis?

‘Possessio' is used in a double
sense by Tacitus, as coming from
‘posside0‚' ‘to retain possession,'
and 6ροεεὶιΙο,1 ‘to get possession)
The latter sense is the one here,
as in A. ii. 5, “ At si mare intretur
prom tam ipsis possessionem.''

d ήίε consiliis] Owing to the
dubious results of warlike opera·
tione generally, Agricola was not
able to lay his plans with any cer-
tainty beforehand. When the mo-
ment of action arrived, therefore,
he found his means inadequately
provided. If he had been able to
map out his intended operations
with perfect certainty, he would
have had ships ready.

quibus nota vada] These could
hardly have been the Batavian
auxiliaries (H. iv. 12, and A. ii. 8),
although they served in Britain3

for they would scarcely have been
acquainted with the British fords.
They must, I think, be native troops,
serving in the Roman arm ¹, as Ta-
citus mentions in e. 29. 3 . Wex
remarks, that if they were Britons,
the Britons of Mona could not he said
to be astonnded at their proceedings.
They might, I suppose, be equally
astounded at being taken in an unex-
pected quarter, whether the assailants
were foreigners or their own coun-
trymen.

qui mare exspectabant] ‘who
expected a sea attack.' The assault
made by fording the shallows did
not seem a sea right, so much as an
attack by land, because they ex-
pected the enemy to make his ap-
pearance on the VVestern or N orthem
coast of the island.

officiorum ambitum] Suetonius
describes Tiberius (c. 12), while in
retirement at Rhodes, as avoiding
‘praeter navigantium officia? Titus
(H. v. l) is said by his courtesy
and affability ‘provocare officia?
‘Officia' therefore are the usual.
complimentary visits, ceremonial
addresses, aud the like, made to a
new magistrate on taking possession
of his government.

in vanitatem usus] ‘Vanus “ means
any thing nnreal, unsubstantial‚as
