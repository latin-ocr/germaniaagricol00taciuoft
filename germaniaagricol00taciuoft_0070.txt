singsularum flentium instituta ri-
tusque] Tacitus here begins the
second part of his work, a descrip-
tion of the localities of the several
German tribes, with an account of
their civil institutions (‘instituta')
and religious observances (‘ritus').
He does this in a certain order. In
c. xxviii. he speaks of tribes of un-
certain origin; in c. xxix—xxxiv.
he describes those who border on
the Rhine towards the TVesu in
c. norw—xxxvii„ the Rhine peo-
ples towards the North; in c.

superior to the Germana, attacked
them, and sent out colonies. There
were no doubt Gauls settled on the
eastern side of the Rhine. He men-

of act-ountiug for it is true also,
The Gauls may either have made
a retrograde mox ement Eastwards‚ as
in fiet they did at other times, or
the localities mentioned may have
been occupied by remnants of an
old Keltic population, dispossessed
in the main by encroaching Teu-
tonic peoples. Tacitus* inferenco
seems as likely to be the true one
as any other. However this may
be tlie Gauls were once no doubt
more powerful than in Caesare
time. They had once occupied
nearly all Spain, conquered Britain,
established thenis elves' in the fairest
provinces of Italy taken Rome
penetrated into lllxria‚ entered Ma·
cedonia, and, crossing the Helles-
pont and the Thracian Bosporus,
overrun a great part of Asia Minor.

dirus] The Roman emperors on
their deccase were usually deified.
The custom apparently began with
Caius Julius Caesar (Suet. Jul. 88),
and seems to have merged into a mere
piece of romine. For an account
of the ceremonies observed on the
occasion, see Smith‘s Dict. of
Antiq„ p. 61. ‘ Divus' came to mean
little more thau ‘the late em-
peror.'
