AGRICOLAE VITA. 153

nemo exploratoribus obvius: quibus in omnem partem
dimissis, ubi incerta fugae vestigia, neque usquam eon-
globari hostes compertum, et exacta jam aestate spargi
bellum nequibat, in fines Borestorum exercitum dedu-
cit. Ibi acceptis obsidibus, praefecto classis circumvehi
Britanniam praecepit: datae ad id vires, et praecesserat
terror: ipse peditem atque equites lento itinere, quo
novarum gentium animi ipsa, transitus mora terrerentur,
in bibernis locavit. Et simul classis secunda tempestate
ac fama Trutulensem portum tenuit, unde proximo latere
Britanniae lecto omni redierat.

XXXIX. Hunc rerum cursum, quanquam nulla ver-
borum jactantia epistolis Agricolae auctum, ut Domi-
tiano moris erat, fronte laetus, pectore anxius excepit.
Inerat conscientia, derisui fuisse nuper falsum e Ger-
mania triumphum, emptis per commercia, quorum ha-

with this idea of size a notion of
something nncouth, shapeless, waste
in fact. ‘Vasta bellua' conveys the
impression of an ugly, misshapen,
overgrown creature.

sec-retieolles] ⁶ lonely retii-ed hills.'
The words are meant here ap-
parently to denote hills left lonely
by the absence of occupiers. This
is a curious use rather ot' ‘secretus'

Borestorum] These people are
not mentioned elsewhere, but are
evidently somewhere north of the
Bodotria.

datae od id] On board the fleet
were soldiers, in order to overpower
the Erimus, wherever the ships
touched. This vorage is alluded to
in c. 10, and duririg it the Romans
discovered and conquered the Ork-
neyS, and caught sight of Thule.
The reputation thus a‹·quired by the
fleet is called ‘ fania' just below.

unde . . . redierat] l believe this
to mean, that the fleet issued from
the Portus Trutulensis‚ somewhere
on the Eastern shore of Britain,
near the Fruth of Tay or Forth pro-
bably, and aster completing its ap—
pointed vnjage, coast-ing the Eastern
shore, and so much of the Northern

and WVestem as was necessary to
assure themselves of the insularity
of Britain, returned to that port.

The ‘ unde' is about equivalent
to ‘quo inde . . . redierat.' VVex
compares A. xi. 38, “ferrumque
accepit, quod frustra jugulo admo-
vens ictu tribuni t1·ansfigitur;'' and
Curt. 3. l. 22, “jamque ad urbem
Ancyram ventum erat ubi numero
copiarum inito, Paphlagoniam in-
tratst' In these cases the relative
entirely belongs to the first clause,
and not at all to the second:
‘ XVhence having coasted the nearer
shore of Britain, it had returned to
it,' equivalent to ‘whithen having
thence‚' ἂο. ‘Redeo' implies tho
success, or, at all events, the com—
pletion of the voyage, as at first
contemplated. A man who returns
unexpectedly before he completes
his intended journey is said ‘re-
vert1.'

XXXIX. Inerat} ‘Inesse' is
often used absolutely. Cf. Livy
ix. 16, “praecipua pedum inerat
pernicitas.” Also, Sall. Cat. 25,
“ prorsus multae facetiae multusque
lepos inerat.''
