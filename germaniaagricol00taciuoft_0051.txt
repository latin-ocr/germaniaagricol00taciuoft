the infernal gods, nr from the pos-
ture of the malefactor while un-
dergoing his sentence, it came to
bear its usual meaning of punish-
ment.

scelera—flagrum] The former is
used for any crime, the latter for
disgraceful vices3 generally in the
way of profligacy or dissoluteness.
Cf. Cicero de Senect. 12, ‘· Stupra
vero et adulteria et omne tale flagi-
tium, nullis aliis illecebris excitari
nisi voluptatis.'’ Here cowardice
is, in the eyes of a warlike nation,
regarded as equivalent to unna-
tural crimes (‘ ignavos . . . . et
corpore infames ⁹). This secret
punishment was not unknown to
the Romans. With them parricides
were put into a sack, and thrown
into the sea. (Cf. Jiiv. viii. :214 )
Amongst the Burgundians faith-
less wives were smothered in the
mud.

pars mulctae] The manuscripts
always vary in this word. some
omitting, some retaining the letter c.
According to Festus, it is an Oscan
word, and seems to have been equi-
valent to ‘numerare‚' as in Plaut.
Stich. iii. l. 9, lt is also said to
have meant, to outbid others at
auctions by raising the price. lf so,
‘multa' would be the better ἴοι-ως
aud the 'word denote punishment
in the way of money or goods
counted down. This word differs
from ‘poena;⁸ the last being a
general term for any punishment,

Sed arma sumere non ante cui-

bodily or otherwise3 while ‘mulcta'
properly implies a fine of money or
cattle, varied at the discretiori of
the imposer, whereas ‘poena' was
defined by law. The part of this
fine paid to the king, as the guardian
of peace, was called the ‘f1·ednm,'
or peace-offe1·ing; the penal sum
paid to the injured person was
terined ⁶ wehrgild.'

consilinm] This word seems used
with a reference to the Roman usage
in judicial inquiries. In the ‘ quaes-
tiones perpetuae ' one of the praetore
presided3 hut the actual verdict was
given hy a body of ‘jndices,' who
were termed his ‘consilium' Cf.
Cic. ad Att. i. 16, “ut quaeque ad
consilium primis postulationibus
referebantur.''

XIII. nisi armati ayunt] A
remnant of this custom is still
found in our island, north of the
Trent, in the division of the country
into NVapentakes, corresponding to
the Hundreds existing elsewhere.
The derivation of this term comes
from the German ‘waepen' and
‘tak,' ‘to touch weapons‚' either
because the assembly touched and
mttled their arms in token of as-
sent. or because the vassals touched
their spears in sign of homage. The
Romans, on the contrary. never
carried arms except in time of war,
or on a journey; in fact, it was
expressly forbidden. amongst other
acts of violence, hy the lex Plotia.
