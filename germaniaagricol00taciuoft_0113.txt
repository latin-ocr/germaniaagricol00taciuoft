AGRICOLAE VITA. 99
nec spem modo ac votum securitas publica, sed ipsius
voti fiduciam ac robur adsumpserit: natura tamen in-
firmitatis humanae, tardiora sunt remedia quam mala; et
ut corpora nostra lente augescunt, cito exstinguuntur, sic
ingenia studiaque oppresseris facilius quam revocaveris.
Subit quippe etiam ipsius inertiae dulcedo, et invisa
primo desidia postremo amatur. Quid si, per quindecim
annos, grande mortalis aevi spatium, multi fortuitis ca-
sibus, promptissimus quisque saevitia principis inter-
ciderunt? Pauci, ut ita dixerim, non modo aliorum,
sed etiam nostri superstites sumus3 exemtis e media
vita tot annis, quibus juvenes ad senectutem, senes prope
ad ipsos exactae aetatis terminos per silentium venimus:
non tamen pigebit vel incondita ac rudi voce memoriam
prioris servitutis, ac testimonium praesentium bonorum
composuisse. Hic interim liber honori Agricolae soceri

per quindecim annos] The fifteen
years, that is, of Domitian's reign.

promptissimus] This word is de-
rived from ‘pr01n0,' and denotes a
person forward to display energy in
any way on occasion3 a ready ulau.

juvenes . . . senes] In which of
these did Tacitus rank himself?
Aulus Gellius remarks, that up to

and ‘cognomen' of his adoptet, and
add his own gentile name with the
termination changed into ‘anus'
For instance, Caius Octavius Rufus,
ou being adopted by Caius Julius
. Caesar, was called Caius Julius
Caesar Octavianus, the Octavia
gens being that to which he be-
longed. But this rule was often
violated, and under the Empire
many irregularities occurred. For

instance, when Caius Plinius Se-
cundus adopted his nephew Caecilius,
his name was Caius Plinius Caecilius
Secundus, instead of Caius Plinius
Secundus Caecilianus,and here Tra-
januslis called Nerva Trajanus irre-
ar a
guirdsdmpserit] This means that
public security has been the subject
of hope and prayers before, but now
for the first time begins to feel con-
fidence and assurance in the sulfil-
ment of its wishes. The verb here
is joined to two clauses‚being strictly
Ἓξζζξὲἴῗ ἓέἒέωῐῗ ᾦὶέἰιὲἂῗῖὲῃῖἱῖἳ
telligible. For similar instances of
zeugma, see c. 45, '‘nos Maurici
Rusticique visus, nos innocenti
sanguine Senecio perfudit.'' Cf.

the forty-sixth year of his life a
man was ‘juniors beyond that age
‘ senior) As Tacitus was born
about ΑΛ). 54, and writing this book
ΑΛ). 97-98, he would be just w³thin
the liinits of the former class.

prioris servitutis] He alludes here
no doubt to the Histories, and the
records of Domitian's tyranny to be
included in them.

composuisse] It seems to me
that Tacitus uses this tense, not
because he already had composed
the records he alludes t03 for, be-
sides other reasons, the word ‘in-
terim' appears to preclude this;
but because he looks forward to the
time when he will be gratified by
the reflectiou of having, in his
earlier days, composed a lasting
