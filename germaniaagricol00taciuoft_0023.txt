habituate their bodies to hardships, and especially cold. In
their earlier years they wear no clothing‚ and youth lasts long
amongst them. Those who are grown up wear cloaks, or the
bark of trees, however severe the winter. They not only have
no repugnance to swimming‘, but actually revel in it. They are
constantly at war ‚with their neighbours, the causes of which
spring frommere caprice3 not from any desire to acquire power,
or enlarge their possessions (for they take no pains to cultivate
what they have), but to have a desert round them. With them
might is right, and therefore even acts of robbery involve no
‘disgrace; they are good· naturcd 01115 to strange1s‚ and kind to
suppliants3 in their mode of living they are so rough and
uncivilized as to eat meat raw or freshly killed, or else, while all
stiff 1n the skins of their cattle and n 1ld 3111111310, they first
soften it by working it with their hands and feet. Their
country is intersected by many rivers, rough with many moun-
tain ranges, and throughout a large portion of its extent im-
passable from woods and marshes. Of these last, the chief are,
‘the Suesia marsh, the Estia, and Melsiagum. Its chief woods
are, the Hercyniam, and some others possessing distinet names3
but the former, being· sixty days' journey ael'OSS, is larger, and
therefore better known than the rest. Its lot'tiest mountains
are Taunus and Rhetioe, excepting some whose names a Roman
mouth can hardly pronounce. Of the rivers which flow through
other countries besides Gerniany the Danube and the Rhone are
the most important3 the Main and the Lippe of those which
fall into the Rhine ; the Ems, the Weser, and the Elbe‚ of those
which reach the ocean. Beyond the Elbe the Sinus Codanus, a
vast gulf, is crowded with islands. Consequently‚ the sea, which
is received into the embrace of the shores, no where presents a
wide expanse‚ or at all resembles a true sea3 on the contrary,
from its waters penetrating in every directim, and often rising
above their bankS, it spreads itself like rivers in a wandering
and widely-diffused course ; where it touches the shores, confined
by the banks of the islands at no great distance on almost every
side alike, it is narrow, and nearly like a strait; then, curving‚
it makes 3 bend round a long jutting promontory, in which the
Cimbri and Teutoni are found, and beyond them the Her-
miones, the remotest inhabitants of Germany.
