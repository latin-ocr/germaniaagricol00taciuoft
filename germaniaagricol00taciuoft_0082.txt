Cimlni] XVhether these people
were a 'leutonic or Keltie race is a
disputed point. Alinost all the ιιι
cient authorities agree in making
the Cimbri« Chersonnese, Jntland
that is, their native home. But if
they were Κοιῑις, it is not easy to
understand how they were so far
separated from their brethren. Per-
haps they were rut off as the rear-
guard of the great Keltic movement
by a rapid influx of Teutonic races.
Their name, so nearly resembling
that of the Kymri, a great dixision
of the Keltic r;,1ce their manners,
described b) Plutarch and the name
of their leader, Bojoitx, are all ιιι
favour of the Keltic extraction.
Tacitus and other writers however
treat them as Germanic, chiefly,
most likely, from their situation
amongst undoubted Ger-mans

bably the 1)·ιιιιιε of the Rhine- and
Danube, although W alther and others
understand by it the Rhine alone.
