76 DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE.

durorum civitas, fida Romanis, eoque solis Germanorum
non in ripa commercium, sed penitus atque iu splendi-
dissima Raetiae provinciae colonia: passim sine custode
transeunt; et cum ceteris gentibus arma modo castraque
nostra ostendamus, his domos villasque patefecimus non

Hermunduris These pce-:le dwelt

between the Sudetes iuonntains and
the Roman wall, boundinz the De-

cumates Agri. According to one
derivation their name is connected
with Her, A·,1 ‘hi h? anl¹1nund,'

and is equivalent to the birrh-

landers. ⁵ As to thcirearliestlocality
there is areat doubt as well us to
their reason for leaving it. The)
were probablya bmnch of the Suevi,
first appearintr in the time of Do—

mitius Ahenobarbus, who granted
them settlements between the Main
and the Danube, in what hail formed
partos the district occupied by the
Marcomani, where Tacitus knows
them. According to Wilhelm their
original ahodes were in Northern
Bohemia, while Strabo places them
beyond the Elbe. Aft1r the fall of
Maroboduus, which they helped to
effect (A. ii. 63), they took posses-
sion of North-western Bohemia,
between the sources of the Maia
and Saale, part of Franconia to
Kissingen, and Southern Saxony.
Afterwards they were abies of the
Marcomani in their contest with
Rome. Their name does uot appear
after this, and they sxem to have
been comprehended undet the geueial
a ppellation of Suexi.

Raetia] In Raetia Tacitus in-
cludes V indelicia: an «1 the. “ colonia'
here. mentioned is Augusta Vinde-
licorum (Augsburff). situated some
distance from the river Danube.

Tacitus probably is hardly correct

Praecipua Marcomanorum

in this remark. The true source of
the Elbe is in Bohemia, a country
of which, suri-ounded as it is by
mountains, 'l :icitus would know
scalcely an) thing. Bv the Elbo
he piobabl) meant one of its western
affluents the Eger or Moldau.
natum oli ιηΙ Tzicitus here alludes
to the eonquests of Drusus, Tibe-
rius and Germanicus. Of Tiberius,
Velleius Pater ulus (ii. 106) says,

‘classis ab inaudito atque incognito
ante mari flumine Albi subvectass’
&a At the time when Tacitus
wrote this book the Romans had
retu-ed nom this part of Germany.

west of the Marcomani, and were
sepiratcd from them by the Silva
Gabreta (Bohmerwald), occupying
Upper Bavaria. 'l'he last notice of
their name occurs in the reign of
Antoninus. and a diffvrent tribe is
subsequently mentioned as occupying
the same localities.

Marcomani] The early scats of
these men of the Marches, appear to
have been in South-wcst Germany,
between the Rhine aud Main. Under
Maroboduus, about ΑΛ). 7, they
crmsed the Engebirge, and expelled
the Keltic Boii. who occupied Bo-
hemia, and established a kingdom
along the Danube almost to Ratis-
bon. This kingdom exciting the
jealousy of the Romans, Tiberius was
ordered to cross the Danube, and

way through the Chatti and the
