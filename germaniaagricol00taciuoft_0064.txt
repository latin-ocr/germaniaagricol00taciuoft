50 DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE.

Crebrae, ut inter vinolentos rixae, raro conviciis,
saepius caede et vulneribus transiguntur. Sed de re-
conciliandis invicem inimicis, et jungendis adfinita-
tibus, et adsciscendis principibus, de pace denique ac
bello plerumque in conviviis consultant: tanquam nullo
magis tempore aut ad simplices cogitationes pateat ani-
mus, aut ad magnas incalescat. Gens non astuta nec
callida, aperit adhuc secreta pectoris, licentia joci. Ergo
detecta et nuda omnium mens postera die retractatur3 et
salva utriusque temporis ratio est. Deliberant, dum fin-
gere nesciuut : constituunt, dum errare non possunt.
