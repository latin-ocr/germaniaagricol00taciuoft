AGRICOLAE VITA. 117
porum olim vietis evenit: ceteri manent, quales Galli
uffifft·1n pedite robur: quaedam nationes et curru
proeliantur: honestior auriga, clientes propugnant. Olim
regibus parebant, nunc per principes factionibus et studiis
trahuntur: nec aliud adversus validissimas gentes pro
nobis utilius, quarn quod in commune non consulunt.
Rarus duabus tribusque civitatibus, ad propulsandum
commune periculum conventus: ita, dum singuli pug-

nant, universi vincuntur.

olim victis] Those Britons who
were reduced in the reigns of Clau·
dius and Nem.

XII. In pedite robur] This does
not imply that the Britons had no
eavalry; they clearly had, for Mela
(iii. 6) describes them as fighting
“non equitatu modo aut pedite,
verum etiam bigis et curribus.''
Caesar also, speaking of the Britons
(iv. 24), says ⁵* barbari praemisso
equitatu et essedariis.'' The use of
the war-chariot was confined to cer-
tain tribes. Perhaps the use of
cavalry proper was restricted to such
tribes as had no ‘ covini.'

honestior auriqa] This was the
reverse of the Greek usage, where
the ἡνίοχυς was of inferior rank to
the παραβάτης, and often styled
θεράπων. These chariots were
driven by the warrior, and carried a
number of his fighting men of lower
rank. On reaching the enemy's line,
these last leaped down and fought
on foot. The ‘aurigae' drove off to
a little distance and stood aloof. In
case the ‘clientes' were distressed,
they were carried off in the chariots.
Cf. Caesar, iv. 33.

Olim reyibus] Some of these kings
are mentioned by Tacitus; for in-
stance, Garamam, king of the
Silures (A. xii. 33); Prasutagus, of
the Iceni (A. xiv. 3l); Cartisman-
dua, queen of the Brigantes (A. xii.
36). By ‘ principes ' he means heads
of the different parties, into which
the states were split up.

Coelum crebris imbribus ae

trahuntur] With this compare
Agricola, “expulsum seditione do·
mestit-a unum ex regulis gentis
exceperat ac specie amicitiae in
occasionem 1·etim·bat‘' (e. 24). Clau-
dius also made equally adroit use of
another ‘regulus' Bericus, under
similar circumstames.

‘Trahuntur' is here used like
‘ distrahuntur) With ¹ trahor' there
is generally something added to make
the meaning clearer. Cf. A. xv. l,
“Vologeses . . . diversas ad curas
trahebatur.''

in commune non consulunt] There
are several variations cf this phrase.
In ‘medium consule1·e,' ‘in unum
consuleres are used in Tacitus and
other writers. ‘ In commune con-
sulere ' is less common.

duabus tribusque] Some of the
editors alter this to ‘duabus tri-
busve.' The difference between the
two expressions seems explained by
a passage in Demosthenes contra
Aphobum, p. 816 A, Ὀ γὰρ πατὴρ
κατέλιπε δύο ἐργαστήρια μαχαι-
ροποιοὺς μὲν τριάκοντα καὶ δύο ἢ
τρεῖς, ἀνὰ πέντε μνᾶς καὶ ἐ’ξ.
There were two or three and thirty
slaves, and some were reckoned at
five minae and some at six. Here
‘duabus tribusvc' would mean that
the Britons united sometimes to the
extent of two, or it might he„ three
states: ‘ duabus tribusque‚' that they
united in some cases to the extent
of two, in others to the extent of
three states.
