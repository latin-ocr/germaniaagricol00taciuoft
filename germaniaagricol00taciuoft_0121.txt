AGRICOLAE VITA. 107
eipatus ac statum urbis Mucianus regebat, admodum
juvene Domitiano et ex paterna fortuna tantum licentiam
· usurpante. Is missum ad delectus agendos Agricolam,
integreque ac strenue versatum, vicesimae legioni tarde
ad sacramentum transgressae praeposuit, ubi decessor
seditiose agere narrabatur: quippe legatis quoque con-
sularibus nimia ae formidolosa erat. Nee legatus prae-
torius ad cohibendum potens, incertum suo an militum
ingenio: ita successor simul et ultor electus, rarissima

moderatione maluit videri invenisse bonos, quam fecisse.

reaches him unexpectedly, or is
brought in a hurried manner, like
καταλαμβάνεσθαι in Greek. Cf.
A. iii. 53, ‘Ipse etiam viderem eos,
ac velut deprehenderem.'

ac statim in partes transm-essm est]
Agricola probably attached himself
to the camp of Antonius Primus.
At least from the account given of
this general's movements in H. ii.
85, 86, and iii. l-lO, this would
be his natural point to take, as he
was on his way to Liguria when
the news reached him.

Mucianus] He was consul ΛΑ).
52, under Claudius, and twice after-
wards. At the death of Nero he
was governor of Syria, and, being
reconciled to Vespasian, supported
his claim to the imperial throne
zealously‚ marching into Europe,
while Vespasian remained in Asia.
On reaching Rome he assumed in
reality the reins of power, although
Domitian was nominally at the head
of affairs. He seems to have died
in Vespasian's reign.

admodum juvene] Tacitus some-
times puts the adverb ‘admodum'
before the adjective (cf. A. i. 3; iv. 13),
and sometimes after (cf. H. ii. 783
iv. 5). Domitian at this time was
about eighteen years old.

ea· paterna fortuna effa] Cf. H. iv. 2,
where Tacitus says of Domitian,
“ nondum ad curas intentus, stupris
et adulteriis filium Principis agebat.''
Cf. also Suet. Domit. l.

vicesimae leslz'oni] This was one
of the four legions at that period

quartered in Britain, the other three
being the Qud, 9111,an‹l l-lth. In the
Itinerary of Antoninus, it is men-
tioned as stationed at Deva, the
modern Chester, where Roman re-
mains, altars, statues, baths, &c.,
are numerous.

decessor] This was Roscius Cae-
lius, who had been at open feud
with Trebellius Maximus (one of
the ‘legati consulares‚' mentioned
just before, being ⁴ consul suffectus ἰ
A.D. 62), and driven him to abandon
the island. He is the ‘legatus prae-
torius' spoken of subsequently.

The imperial provinces were go-
verned by ‘legati p1·aetorii,' ‘con-
sulares,' &c., who were so called,
because the emperor was proconsul
of all the imperial provinces, and
therefore his deputies, like the as-
sistants of the ‘proconsules' of the
Senatorial provinces, were properly
termed ‘ legati.'

incertum suo effic] This was
either because he had no talent for
command, or the troops no idea of
subordination. ‘ Incertum' is used
in an absolute sort of way. Cf.
Λ. xiv. 7, “quos statim acciverat
incertum an et ante ignaros? and
the sentence might be written,
‘quod utrum (suo) ipsius an mi·
litum ingenio acciderit incertum
est.'

‘rarissima ξω] This sentence
means that Agricola, instead of
aiming at an increase of his own
reputation by making a stir, to
bring the disorderly to reason, by
