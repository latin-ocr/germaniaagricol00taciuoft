DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE. 59
signe: nam nec tributis contemnuntur nec publicanus
atterit: exempti oneribus et collationibus, et tantum in
usum proeliorum sepositi, velut tela atque arma, bellis
reservantur. Est in eodem obsequio et Mattiacorum gens.
Protulit enim magnitudo populi Romani ultra Rhenum,
ultraque veteres terminos, imperii reverentiam. Ita sede
finibusque in sua ripa, mente animoque nobiscum agunt,
cetera similes Batavis, nisi quod ipso adhue terrae suae
solo et coelo acrius animantur. Non numeraverim inter
Germaniae populos, quanquam trans Rhenum Danu-
biumque consederint, eos, qui Decumates agros exercent.

employed by the Romans, under
Drusus, Tiberius, and Germanicus,
as cavalry on the Lower Rhine.
They served also in Britain in the
reign of Claudius. After an attempt
to throw off the Roman yoke under
Civilis, ΑΛ). 69, they were again
reduced to submission. As for the
phrase ⁵ societatis insigne,' it seems
only to refer “to the exemptions
from tribute mentioned directly
afterwards, and to have no referem-e
to hands of silvcr joined together,
described in H. i. 54.

tributis] ‘'l'ributum' was ori-
ginally the direct tax levied on
Roman citizens according ιο the
value of their property, land οι·
personal: this was afterwards rc-
mitted‚ so far as they were con-
cei-ned, but imposed on the provinces.
There, every subject possessed of
land, paid a tax of ten per cent. on
the annual produce in grain, and
five per cent. on that in wine,
fmits, &c.; while those who had
uo land, paid on their personal
effects. lf these imposts were paid
in kind, the provincials were ⁴ vec-
tigales? if a money contribution
was made, forming a fixed rent-
charge, they were termed ‘stipen-
diarii) From these taxes the Batavi
were free, being not only exempt
from ‘onera,' fixcd impons, but
from ‘colhrtioneffi¹ extraordinary
charges, either voiuntary, like our
old benevolences, or forced.

Mattiacorum yens] This people
uas situated in the ‹lurhy of Nassau,
near Wiesbaden, between the Mae-
nns (Malu), Lagana (Lahn), and
the Rhine. Tacitus (H. iv. 37) men-
tions them in conjunction with the
Chatti and Usipii, as besieging Ma-
gontiacum (Mainz); and Pliny
(xxxi. ⁴2) describes the warm foun-
tains existing amongst them. They
are os course spoken of here out
of their due place (see note ou
c. xxviii.) merely because they aro
on a similar footing with the Ba-
tavi.

mente animoque] Caesar (i. 39)
joins these words together: ‘⁶ Tantus
subito timor . . . . exercitum occu-
pavit, ut . . . . omnium mentes
animosque perturbaret.'' thereby
I understand him to imply that the
sudden fright upset their reasoning
saculties aud impulsive emotions3
they were suddenly cowed‚ and they
could not reason themselves out of
.their panic. Tacitus means about
the same here,I think 3 the Mattiaci
from rational conviction and seel-
ing held with the Romans, and not
with their own countrymen.

solo et coelo] That is, their country
was luilly, and not mai-shy, like that
of the Batavi : the air was therefore
keener, and more bracing than the
sogs of the Insula Batavorum.

Decumates cyrus] This was a
district north of the Danube, and
east of the Rhine (Baden, most of
