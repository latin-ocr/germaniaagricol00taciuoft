AGRIOOLAE VITA.

nebulis foedum: asperitas frigorum abest. Dierum spatia
ultra nostri orbis mensura1n3 nox clara et extrema
Britanniae parte brevis, ut finem atque initium lueis exi-

guo discrimine internoscas.

Quod si nubes non officiant,

aspici per noctem solis fulgorem, nec occidere et exsur-
gere, sed transire adfirmant: seilicet extrema et plana
terrarum humili umbra non erigunt tenebras, infraque

eoelum et sidera nox eadit.

a eritas frigorum abest] Caesar
(v, 2) makes a similar remark.
No doubt the temperature of Britain,
Germany, and Gaul was lower
before the countries were cleared
than now, but there would probably
be the same ratio preserved between
their respective elimam: the insular
position of Britain and the Gulf
Stream contributing to its higher
temperature.

Dierzcm spatia affine] Pliny (ii. 77)
gives a list of the length of the days
at different places on the earth's
surface. In Italy the longest day
has fifteen hours, iu Britain seven-
teen, the nights being correspond-
ingly long at the opposite seasons of
the year. Hence Juvenal (ii. 161)
talks of “ Orcadas, et minima con-
tentos nocte Britannos.” In the
Orkneys, in lat. 60, the longest day
is a little over eighteen hours in
length.

aspici per noctem solis ficlyorem]
Tacitus here asserts of Britain what
.is true of countries in very much
higher latitudes. Pytheas of Mar-
seilles (Plin. ii. ἶῖ) describes the
night and day of Thule, six days'
voyage North of Britain, as consist-
ing each of six months3 but this is
only true within the Polar circle.
Lord Mulgrave, in his Travels‚ says,
that in lat. sixty-five, on the l2th
¹of June, it was light enough to read
all night; so that Tacitus is not very
far out when he says “finem atque
initium lucis exiguo certamine in-
vt.ernoscas.‘'

solis ficlyorem, effa] Pomponius
Mela says '⁴ quanquam (sol) ipse non

Solum, praeter oleam vitem-

cematur‚ vicino tamen splendore
proxima illustrat.'' lf the subject
of ‘transire' in the text is ‘ful-
gorem,' this remaik would be lite-
rally true of alatitude not very much
higher than that of the Orkneys.
Although the sun is below the
horizon, yet he is so little below it
that his course may almost be traced,
and his position at any moment cor-
rectly fixed. However, I think
Tacitus intends the subject to be
‘ solem‚' not ‘ fulgorem.'

eoetrema et plana terrarum] One
can hardly suppose Tacitus to have
beenignorant of the earth's sphericity‚
a property known to Pliny (ii. 64)
and others at a date earlier than the
historian's His idea—so far as his
words convey any distinct idea—
appears to be as follows: the earth
from Britain to the Pole sloped
abruptly‚ so as to be almost flat; at
all events much flatter than else-
where. Behind this the sun de-
scended only a little way. Clearly,
the result of this would be that the
central parts of the earth would
throw upwards a long shadow reach-
ing to the sky, and so causing night.
The parts near the Pole, from their
fiatness‚ and the factos the sun being
so little below the horizon, would
vast a shadow rising to a short
distance only above the earth. By
this shadow, or night (‘ Quippe
manifestum estnon aliud esse noctem
quam terrae umbram‚' Plin. ii. 7),
the ground near the Pole would be
darkened‚ but far above its highest
point the stars would shine unob-
scured by the lower darkness.
