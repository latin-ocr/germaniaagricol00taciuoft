DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE. 77

gloria viresque atque ipsa etiam sedes, pulsis olim Boiis,
virtute parta. Nec Narisei Quadive degenerant. anue
Germaniae velut frons est, quatenus Danubio peragitur
Marcomanis Quadisque usque ad nostram memoriam
reges manserunt ex gente ipsorum, nobile Marobodui et
Tudri genus: jam et externos patiuntur. Sed vis et
potentia regibus ex auctoritate Romana: raro armis nos-
tris, saepius pecunia juvantur; nee minus valent.

XLIII. Retro Marsigni, Gothini, Osi, Buri terga
Marcomanorum Quadorumque claudunt: e quibus Mar-
signi et Buri sermone cultuque Suevos referunt. Go-
thinos Gallica, Osos Pannonica lingua coarguit, non esse

Hercynian forest, to attack the Mar-
comani. The attention of the Ro-
mans, hou-ever, being drawn else·
where, the scheme failed. Thi-ough-
0ut the Pannonian and Dalnzatian
wars. Maroboduus remained neutral.
In the war against the Cherusci,
under Arminius, Maroboduus was
forced to retire *to his own haunts,
whence hc was afterwards driven out
by Catualda, who was in turn ex-
pelled by the Hermunduri. Their
followers were placed beyond the
Danube between the March and the
Waag. The great Marcomanic war
broke out A.1›. 167, aud lasted thir-
teen years. They were defeated near
Aquileia by Marcus Aurelius, who
pursued them across the Alps, and
totally routed them. They disappear
from history after the fifth cen-
tury.

Quadi] The Quadi were settled
between the Mons Gabreta, the Sar-
matian Mountains‚ and the Danube,
in Moravia and North-western
Hungary. They were generally as-
sociated with the Marcomani, and
joined them in theirgreat war against
Aurelius. After the fifth century
they were merged in other nibes.

pera-qitzar] ‘the siont of Ger-
many, so far as that frunt is formed
by the Danube.' But this is an odd
expression, and some of the editors
read ⁴ praetexitur-‚⁴ or ‘ porrigitur.'

externos] Such ‘externi’ were

Catualda (A. ii. 6’2), and Vannius
(A. ii. 63). Cf. also A.. xii. 30.

uec· minus rolens] 'l'hat is to say,
the German ltings found ihe Roman
subsidies ol‘ money as effcctual a.
means of strengtlnning their position
as the suppoit of the R· inan arms.
The money they received enabled
them to take armies into their pay.
One king is mentioned as obtaining
this pecuniary help, Chariomerus,
king of the Cherusci.

X Ll 11⁷ Allo r.»z{u111',9}·e.] TheMarsigni
probably extended from the Riesen-
gebirge, in Northern Boliemia, to the
Ode1*‚0‹⁴cup·xingpartofmodernSilesia.

The Gothini were situated near the
head-waters of the Marus (March),
in L'pper Silesia and Moravia.

Thedistrict of the Osi lay between
the sources of the Oder and the
Gran, on the fronticis of Moravia
and Hungary.

The Buri were between the Oder
and the Vistula, between Cim-ow and
Troppau, in Silesia. They were
allies of Trajan in his war against
the Dacians, and also of Marcus
Aurelius, in the Mart-omnnio war.

reserum] Cf. c. 20, ‘robora pa-
rentum liberi refe1·unt.' With a
varied construction Juvenal has the
same meaning, ⁵ et multum referens
de Maecenate supino.'

Geminos Gallica. esne] These Go-
thini mav have been a remnant of
the great Keltic em igraticns eastward,
