que XXII. ad Taum] The Frith of
Tay. Theie is a reading ‘ad Ta-
naum.' lVex supposes this to be
the Estuary of the T yne3 others the
Tweed; but these are evidently too
far south. Theie seems a want of
clearness about the conquests and
proceedings of the several years of
Agricola'scommand. In the second
year, 116 appears to have reached the
'Scottish bor·;de1s in the thi1d‚ he
found his way usque ad Taum?

in the foui th >ean Tadtus describes
him as consolidating his conquests,
and establishing forts across the
Isthmus, between othe Friths of
Forth and Clyde3 in the fifth year,
he advances beyond this line of
forts, aniongst nations ‘ unknown to
that time.³ Probably Tacitus in-
tends us to understand that Agricola
only hastily overran the Eastern
part of Caledonia beyond the Forth
to the Tay and then ietir‚ed secm-

ing at first only so much of the
country as lay South of the 1 01-,th
and reserving to another year the

Adnotabant periti] The same
phrase occurs A, xii. 25, and H.
iii. 37, ‘ periti' being merely equi—
valent to competent judges, and
taking its precise meaning, whether
skilrul' 111 militam tictics, or skilful
in jurispiudence, from the context.

nam advetsssas tica] The Roman
gairison in the forts were able to
make frequent sallies, because as
11161 11616 thorouo ghly supplied with
provisions (ι annuis copiis )‚ the
61161111 thought it useless to attempt
a blot-kade on the chance of starving
them out. They were therefore left
unmolested. One of these forts was
at Ardoch probably in Pcrthshire,
where extens 116 remains have been
found, and still, Ι believe, exist.
This particular fort is said to be in
a very commanding position, and to
fully justify the eulogium on Agri-
cola's skill in choosing his sites.

inritis hostibus] ‘ the enemy being
baffled.' Cf. A. iii. 21, “Inritum
fessumque Romanum impune ludii-
ficabatur.''

praefectus] These ‘ praefecti ³ are
often mentioned with ‘tribuni'
(H. iv. 78), ⁸ legati' (H. iii. 19), and

‘centurions' (H. iv, 14). They held
the same position in the auxiliary
troops of the allies as the tribunes
in the legionaries. There were six
