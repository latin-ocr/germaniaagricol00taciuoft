(Book 1V.,27—29.)

Clearer information dawns upon us as we approach the tribe
of Ingaevones, the first people in (lermany in that quarter. An ,
extensive mountain range, called seve, equal in height to the
Riphaean chain, makes a vast gulf known by the name of
Codanus, stretching as far as the promontory of the Cimbri, and
crowded with islands. Of these the most famous is Scan-
dinavia, of unascertained extent, the only part known being
occupied by 500 cantoris of the tribe of Hilleviones‚ who term it
a second world. Eningia is thought to be equally large. Some
authors tell us these regions, as far as the river Vistula, are
occupied by Sarmatae, Venedi, Sciri, and Hirri. The promontory
of the Cimbri, jutting far out into the sea, makes a peninsula
called Cartris. Three-and-twenty islands are known to the
Roman arms; of which the most famous is called Fabaria
(Borkum), from its resemblance to a wild bean. Again, there is
Glessaria (Ameland), from the amber found by our soldiers 3 the
barbarians themselves call it Austrania3 Actania (Schelling) is
another of these islands.

Of the Germane there are five races3 the Vindili, subdivided
into Burgundiones Varini, Carini, and Guttones; the second
are the Ingaevones, consisting, amongst others, of Cimbri,
Teutoni, and the various tribes of Chauci. Nearest to the
Rhine are the Istaevones3 the Cimbri of the interior belong to
these; fourthly, there are the Hermiones, consisting of Suevi,
Hermunduri, Chatti, Cherusci. The fifth race is the Peucini
Bastarnae bordering on the Daci. Several well-known rivers fall
into the sea, the Gruttalus (Pregel), Vistula, Elbe, Weser, Ems,
Rhine, Maas. The Hercynian range stretches towards the
interior, equal in celebrity to any mountain chain. In the very
channel of the Rhine, extending about one hundred miles in
length, is situated the famous island of the Batavi and Can-
nenufates3 besides this there are other islands belonging to the
Frisii, Chauci, Frisiabones, Sturii, Marsacii, strewing the coast
between Helium Ostium and Flevum Ostium. These are the
names of the mouths where the Rhine, discharging itself by
