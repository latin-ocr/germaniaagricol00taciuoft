DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE. 41

XVI. Nullas Germanorum populis urbes habitari,
satis notum est: ne pati quidem iuter se junctas sedes.
Colunt discreti ae diversi, ut fons, ut campuS, ut nemus
placuit. Vicos locant, nou in nostrum morem, connexis
et cohaerentibus aedificiis: suam quisque domum spatio
circumdat, sive adversus casus ignis remedium, sive in-
scitia aedificandi. Ne caementorum quidem apud illos
aut tegularum usus: materia ad omnia utuntur informi,
et eitra speciem aut delectationem. Quaedam loca dili-
gentius illinunt terra, ita pura ac splendente, ut picturam
ae lineamenta colorum imitetur. Solent et subterraneos
specus aperire, eosque multo insuper fimo onerant, suffu-
gium hiemi et receptaculum frugibus: quia rigorem
frigorum ejusmodi locis molliunt: et si quaudo hostis
advenit, aperta populatur: abdita autem et defossa, aut
ignorantur, aut eo ipso fallunt, quod quaerenda sunt.

vertit ad Rhenum.'' But by ‘urbs'
the Romans intended a town with
fortifications‚ temples, &c.‚ and of
these there were of course none
amongst the Germans. There is no

‘phalerae' were given to horsemen
as prizes for superior brai-eryx

‘ Torques' were twisted circlets of

gold, worn round the neck, ori-
ginally by the Persians and other
nations of Nox-thern and Western
Europe. They were in common use
amongst the Gauls, and · Quinctilian
mentions a hage one given by that
people to Augustus. They were
worn by the Keltie Britons, and
have often been found in Enqland,
sometimes made of several platted
cordS, and weighing as much as l, 2,
or even 3 lbs.

«Iam et pecuniam] Tacitus alludes
to this fact in H. iv. 76, “Germanos
cuncta ex libidine agere, pecuniam-
que ac dona quis solis corrumpantur,
majora apud Romanos.''

XVI. Nullas. . . . urbes] Ptolemy‚
writing some sixty years later than
Tacitus, mentions as many as seventy
cities. By these he no doubt meant
only clusters of hnts or wigwams
gathered round some wood or spring,
and these Tacitus himself speaks os,
A. i. 56, “ Caesar, incenso Mattio,
id genti caput, aperta populatus,

hint in the account of their wars with
the Romans of their retiring for
shelter behind the walls οἵ any
towns; it was rather to woods, mo-
rasses‚ δια, they betook themselves

citra speciem] The preposition
‘citi-a,¹ connected probably with
‘ hicss the guttural ‘ ci ¹ being sosten-
ed into ‘ hi: means ‘on this side of.'
Therefore ‘ citra speciem* is ‘stopping
short of beauty;' not going fai
enough in their work to cross the
line dividing plainness from beauty;
not taking pains to make it hand-
some.

aut eo ipso fallunt] ‘Fano' is
used herc in the scnsc of escaping
notice3 as in Horace, Carm. iii. 19,
“Spartacum si qua. potuit vagantem
Fallere testa 3⁹³ and Epist. i. 17. 10.
The passage means that these sub-
terranean caves are either altogether
unknown to the enemy, or supposing
the enemy to have a general idea of
their locality‚ yet they baffle dis-
covery, because they can only be
