mentioned, which in the Germania are entirely omitted: for
instance, the Canninefates (11. iv. 15), the Gugerni (H. iv. 15),
the Tubantes (A. i. 51), the Anisivarii (A. xiii. 56), the Sugambri
(A. ii. ⁶26). 'Tacitus probably learned more as he advanced in
years and carried out more sully his historica] researches. His
aim 111 this work seems not simply to diffuse information about
thc barbarous tribes, so pertinacious in resisting Roman
aggression, but also to contrast their simplicity of life with the
artificial civilization of his countryinen. He continually draws
attention to the conti-ast between the habits of the two people
(c. 19. 25), either directly or iinplicit1y3 and in order to do
so in one particular (c. 26), after remarking that money was
unknown amongst them, he proceeds to add,--an observation

matizing indirectly the vices of the Romans, ——that usury was
not piactised by them. It does not appear tha-t Tacitus had
any peculiar means of obt-tinius* information about Germany.
Cornelius Tacitus is mentioned by Pliny (vii. 17 Tauchnitz)
as Plocurator of Gallia Belgica3 but as Pliny djecl A..D 79,
this person cannot have been the Historian, nor I think is he
likely to have been his father. There is not any reason to suppose
that Tacitus visited Germany. What he knew was derived
probably from the report brought home by those? who-had
taken part in the great expeditions of Drusus and Gemani9u8‚
and the accounts of traders. The information, so far as it
relates to tribes bordering on the Rhine, and therefore well
known to the Romans, is no doubt precise and authentic; for
the account of remoter tribes Tacitus must have been dependent
on vague hearsay and obscure repom
