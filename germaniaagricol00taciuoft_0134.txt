120 AGRICOLAE VITA.
saxis avelli; in Britannia, prout expulsa sint, colligi:
ego facilius crediderim, naturam margaritis deesse quam
*nobis avaritiam.

--XI-II. Ipsi Britanni delectum ac tributa et injuncta
imperii munera impigre obeunt, si injuriae absint: has
aegre tolerant, jam domiti ut pareant, nondum ut serviant.
Igitur primus oninium Romanorum divus Julius cum
exercitu Britanniam ingressus, quamquam prospera pugna
terruerit incolas ac litore potitus sit, potest videri osten-
disse posteris, non tradidisse. Mox bella civilia et in
rempublicam versa principum arma, ac longa oblivio
Britanniae etiam in pace. Consilium id divus Augustus
vocabat: Tiberius praeceptum. Agitasse Caium Cae-
sarem de intranda Britannia satis constat, ni velox inge-
nio, mobilis poenitentiae, et ingentes adversus Germaniam

no doubt to Trajan's extension of
the Roman empire to the Persian

ΧΙΙΙ. munera] This means the
various imposte of an extraordinary
nature imposed on the Britons from
time to time‚-—what Tacitus else-
where terms ‘collationes‚'—or any
regular contributions not falling
under ‘ tributa ς’ such perhaps as the
‘frumentum in cellam: supplied
for the niaintenance of the governor
and his establishnient. The word
can hardly mean work done for the
Romans, or duties performed. Ta-
citus seems to use ‘munia' in that
sense. Cf. A. i. 11, “munia rei-
publicae sociatis laboribus exsecu-
turos.'' Also‚ A. 1· 16. 31. 69,
as) compared with A. iv. 26; xiv.

Iyz'tztr] Tacitus seems to regal-d
this description of the Britons as a
digression, and he resumes the
thread of his main narrative with
the word ‘ igitur? Cf. Sall. Jng. 19,
‘ Igitur ad Catabathmon? δια, after a.
parenthetical sentence.

Consilium] Tacitus (A. i. 11)
mentions a note-book conipiled by
Augustus, containing an account of

the provinces, taxes, armies, &c., of
the empire. The historian adds,
“addiderat consilium coercendi in-
tra terminos imperii incertum metu
an per invidiam.” lt suited the
wily and crooked policy of Tiberius
to fall back, with a view to hide his
real motives, on some order handed
down from Augustus, especially
when, as in this ease, there hap-
pened to be undoubted colour for
it·q although if there had been none,
Tiberius was likely enough to pre-
tend there was. This assumed or
real regard paid by Tiberius to the
wishes of Augustus is mentioned
elsewhere. Speaking (A. i. 77) of
the Intemessio of Haterius Agrippa
on a proposal to make actors liable
to the Praetor's rod, Tacitus says,
‘⁴ Valuit intercessio, quia divus
Augustus immunes verberum his-
triones quondam responderat, neque
sas Tiberio infringere dicta ejus.''
In A. iv. 37, Tiberius speaks of
himself as one, “qui omnia facta
dictaque ejus vice legis observem.''
mobilis poeniteutiae] This genitive
is a favourite construction with
Tacitus: he has ‘modicus volupta-
tum‚’ ‘properus i1·ae‚' ‘ferox linguae,'
&a But ‘mobilis poenitentiae'
seems a little awkward. In the
