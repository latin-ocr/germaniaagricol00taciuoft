AGRICOLAE VITA.

95

que ingenio, ad prodendam virtutis memoriam, sine gra-
tia aut ambitione, bonae tantum conscientiae pretio, duce-

batur.

Ac plerique suam ipsi vitam narrare, fiduciam

potius morum quam adrogantiam arbitrati sunt: nec id
Rutilio et Scauro citra fidem aut obtrectationi fuit: adeo
virtutes iisdem temporibus optime aestimantur, quibus

facillime gignuntur.

meaning of Tacitus here or else-
where. Wherever he uses the ex-
· ression (cf. Agric. 33, and H. iii.
26), it implies the opposite of ‘ar-
tus,' or ‘impeditus,' ⁸ not pent in by
obstacle83' being a metaphor from
open ground, where one's movenients
are not hampered by want of space.
sine qratia aut ambitione] The
writers alludcd to ,showed no ar-
tiality towards the subjects oft eir
narrative, and made no attempt to
gain favour with their readers. Cf.
Cic. ad Famv. 12.
rique suam ipsi vitam narrare]
T eregularconstruction here would be
‘ipsorum,' or ‘ ipsos ι’ but the ‘ ipsi ’
is attracted to ‘arbitrati sunt.' Α
stranger construction still occurs in
Sallust (Jug. 18), “Passim multis
sibi quisque imperium petentibus.''
In fact, ‘ipse' or‘ ipsi sihi' is almost
used like a single word. There is
a similar tmjection to the one here
in Liv. iv. 44, “causa ipse pro se
dicta quindecim milibus aeris dam-
natm-3¹ ‘ Plerique ' is generally used
by other writers in the sense of
‘most’ (Caesar vi. 14, and Β. civ.
iii. 29). Tacitus uses it for ‘ many.'
cf. A. iv. 9, “plerisque additis ut
erIrmegaiimat posterior adulatio,” also

. ι. .

Rutilio et Scauro] Rutilius and
Scaurus are mentioned as forming
one instance of what he means; con-
sequently ‘et’ is used and not the
disjunctive ¹ aut.'

P. Rutilius Rufus was a military
tribune under Scipio in the Nu-
mantine war, and Consul, Rc. 105.
From havin repressed the extortion
of the ‘publgicani ⁹ whilst legatus to
Q. Mucius Scaevola in Asia, B.c.

95, he incurred the hatred of the
knights, who at that time not only
fai-med the revenue, but acted as
‘judices' in crimina] trials. On his
return he was accused ⁸ de repetun-
dis' and banishrd. Although re-
called by Sulla, he refused to return,
making Smyrna his residem-e. He
wrote an autobiography in five books
or more, and a History of Rome in
Greek, containing an account of the
Numantine war, in which he was
personally concerned.

M. Aemilius Scaurus was also
probab'y engaged in the Numantine
war. He was one of the leading men
at Rome when Adherbal came to
ask help against Jugurtha. He was
Consul in 13.c. 115, and legatus to
L. Calpurnius Bestia in the Jugur-
thine war. ln B c. 107. he was again
Consu].and he and Rutilius mutually
accused each other of bribery. He
wrote three books on his own life, a
work mentioned by Cicero (Brut. 29),
“hujus et orationes sunt et tres ad
L. Fufidium libri scripti de vita
ipsius acta sane utiles quos nemo
le 't.”

giss nunc . . . tempora] This is
a very uncertain passage as regards
the meaning, for it is difficult to fix
the reading. As the words stand,
‘nunc' seems used by Tacitus, in
opposition to the olden times when
it was usual to write histories of
illustrious men, and not to denote
the exact date of the period when he
wrote the book; referring rather to
the general state of things in Do-
mitian’s reign. Then 'fuit' is put
for ‘fuissctz' just as in A. i. 35,
Tacitus says, ‘⁶ sermm a latere de-
ripuit, elatumque deferebat in pectus
