AGRICOLAE VITA. 155

verborum honore cumulata, decerni in senatu jubet,
addique insuper opinionem, Syriam provinciam Agricolae
destinari, vacuam tum morte Atilii Rufi consularis et
majoribus reservatam. Credidere plerique libertum ex
secretioribus ministeriis missum ad Agricolam codicillos
quibus ei Syria dabatur, tulisse, cum praecepto, ut, si in
Britannia foret, traderentur: eumque libertum in ipso
freto Oceani obvium Agricolae, ne appellato quidem eo,
ad Domitianum remeasse: sive verum istud, sive ex in-
genio principis fictum ac compositum est. Tradiderat
interim Agricola successori suo provinciam quietam
tutamque. Ac ne notabilis celebritate et frequentia oc-
currentium introitus esset, vitato amicorum officio, noctu
in urbem, noctu in palatium, ita ut praeceptum erat,
venit : exceptusque brevi osculo et nullo sermone turbae
servientium immixtus est. Ceterum uti militare nomen,
grave inter otiosos, aliis virtutibus temperaret, tranquil-
litatem atque otium penitus auxit, cultu modicus, sermone
facilis, uno aut altero amicorum comitatus: adeo ut ple-
rique, quibus magnos viros per ambitionem aestimare

would include the ‘ supplicatio‚' and
the public sacrifices.

addique . . opinionem] This seems
to imply that Domitian gave
orders to have the Senatus Con-
sultum so worded, as to give fair
ground for supposing that Agricola
gas to succeed to the province of

na.

yet majoribus reservatam] This
means to say that Syria was usually
destined for persons of eminence.
So sar the rumour of its being in-
tended for Agricola was a com-
pliment.

tulisse, cum praecepto] Domitian
was anxious to withdraw Agricola
from Britain, where, from his mili-
tary reputatinn, he might have be-
come formidable as a competitor for
the empire. A confidential freed-
man (Ἔδει-ωτι] ex secretioribus
ministeriis') was therefore sent, with
an official document, appointing him
to the command of Syria, in order
to detach him from his British

legions. As the freedman met him
already returning, the device was
unnecessary, and he therefore re-
turned to Rome at once, without
even addressing Agricola.

sire eac inyenio principis] The
stor was either truc, or might
easilyy have been sog for the schemo
it supposed was exactly suited to ,the
emperor's character.

successori suo] Suetonius, Domit.
lO, mentions that Sallustius Lu-
cullus, a ‘legatus' of Britain, was
put to death by Domitian, for the
serious crime of having allowed
dishes ofa novel pattern to be called
Lucullean, after his own name.
Possibly this was Agricola's suc-
cessor. After Agricola's return,
Caledonia does not seem to have
been long retained by the Romans,
as Tacitus says in the History (i. 2),
“Britannia perdomita et statim

amissa.”
per ambitionem aestimare] To
