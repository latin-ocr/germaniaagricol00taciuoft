AGRICOLAE VITA. 111

boni indulgent, ostentanda virtute aut per artem quae-
sivit: procul ab aemulatione adversus collegas, procul a
contentione adversus procuratores: et vincere inglorium
et atteri sordidum arbitrabatur. Minus triennium in ea
legatione detentus, ac statim ad spem consulatus revocatus
est, comitante opinione Britanniam ei provinciam dari:

nullis in hoc suis sermonibus, sed quia par videbatur.

Haud semper errat fama, aliquando et eligit.

Consul

egregiae tum spei filiam juveni mihi despondit, ac post
consulatum collocavit, et statim Britanniae praepositus
est, adjecto pontificatus sacerdotio.

wueyas] These would be the
governor-s of the neighbouring pro-
vinces, Gallia Narbonensis, Lug-
dunensis, Belgica. So in H. i. 10,
a Praefect of Syria is said to be
“apud subjectos, apud proximos,
apud collegas variis inlecebris po-
tens.” In A. xiii. 53, Aelius Gra-
cilis, Legatus of Belgica, is mentioned
as looking enviously on his neigh-
bours, the Legati of Germany.

procuratores] There was only one
Brocurator in each province, but in
the three years of Agricola's govern-
ment there may have been several :
or the plural may be put generally,
‘such rivalry as is generally seen
between Legati and Procuratores?

atteri] There was no credit in
getting the better of an inferior like
a Procurator, and great disgrace in
being crushed by one. ‘Atteri' is
to be bruised against any thing.

Minus trienninm] According to
Dion Cassius it was Maecenas who
suggested three years as the term for
the Legati to hold their government.
Tiberius however did not act on the
suggestion, but continued his Legati
in office for many years, and some-
times all their lives.

After ‘ minus‚' ‘ amplius‚' ‘ plus‚' in
the computatiou of time or numbers,
the ‘ quam' is generally omitted, and
the noun or adjective put in the case
required by the construction of the
sentence, as ‘ amplius sexcenti occisi
sunt,' ⁶ more than 600 were killed:

nullis in hoc suis sermonibus]
Tacitus uses an ablative absolute
without any participle, but one of
existence, as “nullis contra terris:
libero quid firmaret mutaretve;'' a
construction not very usual in other
writers.

Consul] He was Consul suffectus
with Domitian Λ.ῐ). 77, Vespasiau
and Titus having been Consuls from
the lst of January to the end ofJune.
This is no doubt the reason why
Tacitus passes over his office so
lightly.

eyreyioe tum spei] This seems a
particularly appropriate expression,
because the young lady between her
betrothal and marriage was called
apparently sometimes ‘sperata‚‘ as
well as ‘ sponsa,' ‘pacta,' ἃς. For-
cellini quotes three passages to the
point, two from Nonius ; “ Curre et
nuntia me venire et meum speratum
adduce,'' of a bridegroom; and
“speratam non odi tuam ·,” and a
third from Arnobius, '⁶ Uxores dii
habent? habent speratas, habent
pactas‚'' διο.

filiam] Agricola was Consul A.1).
77, and this daughter having been
born during his qnaestorship in A.1>.
63, probably would only be fourteen
years old at the betrothal. Itwas cus-
tomary to betroth girls while quite
young (not under seven). Augustus
forbadc betrotlial before ten, so that
betrothal should not last more than
two years
