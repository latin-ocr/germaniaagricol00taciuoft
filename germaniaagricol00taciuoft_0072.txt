58 DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE.

originis ultro ambitiosi sunt, tanquam per hanc gloriam
sanguinis, a similitudine et inertia Gallorum separentur.
Ipsam Rheni ripam haud dubie Germanorum populi co-
lunt, Vangiones, Triboci, Nemetes. Ne Ubii quidem,
quanquam ‘'Romana colonia esse meruerint, ac libentius
Agrippinenses conditoris sui nomine vocentur, origine
erubescunt, transgressi olim et experimento fidei super
ipsam Rheni ripam collocati, ut arcerent, non ut custo-
direntur.

Batavi, non multum ex ripa, sed insulam Rheni amnis

ference that, in his opinion the
Teutonic orioin of the Tleveri and
Nervii uas doubtful At all events,
the Treveri were probably a Keltic
race. Their name sugges ts the
Comish Trelawnex, and similar
compounds of‘ tie? a Keltic word

(1151111811) asserts the language of
the Galatae of Phrjg ia to be the
same as that of the T'ieveri.

this people was descended fromp the
Cimbri. If so this would be an
argument in favoni of their Keltic,
rather than Germanic oxigin.

Triboci] This would also appear
to be a Keltic tiihe (see the note
on Tiwexeri); and besides this one
of the names of their towns given
by Ptolemy Βμευκ κόμαγος is Keltic
in form, and they ale mentioned by
Tacitus (H iv. 70) in conjunction
with appatently Keltic nibes. The
substance of these last notes is taken
from Dr. Lathani.

Ubii . . . ] The Ubii· 111 Caesar' s
time were East of the Rhine; but
(A. xii 27) in the reign of Augustus
they removed across the river, to
escape fiom the Chatti, under the
protection of Vipsanius Afflippa,
from whom, according to this pas-
sage, they were called Agrippinenses.

Generally however the foundation
of the colony is ascl ibed to Agrippina,
daughter of Caesar Germanicus.

XXIX insulam Rheni] Tacitus
(Α. ii. 6) places the Batavi 111 the
island between the main branch of
the Rhine, where it divides at Bur-
ginatium, the Vahalis (lVaalL and
the Mosa (Mna), after the Vahalis
flows into it. ’1118 island is bounded
on the west b) the sea. According
to Ρ1111) the island was 100 miles
in length, anl its breadth increases
from the point of junction of the
two rivers, to about twenty-five
miles. Tmces of the name still
remain in Betuwe, the district be-
tween the Rhine, Waal, and Lek.
By the words ‘ non multum ex ripa·
just before, Tacitus seems to mean
that over and above the island they
occupied a portion of the left bank
of the Rhine, outside the island
altogether·, and by the Rhine he
clearly means 1118 Vahalis, as a
portion of 1118 larger stream. The
Batavi therefore occupied a portion
of the district bounded on the north
by the Waal, and south by the
Maas. The quantity of the middle
syllable of Bataxi' varies, being
found both long and s.hort

societatis] The Batavi were allies
of Rome under Augustus, and were
