XXVI. Quod ubi cognitum hosti, mutato repente
consilio, universi nonam legionem, ut maxime invalidam,

A. vi. 30,
‘Dum Lentulo Gaetulico pericu-.

aperto . . . clauderetur] Either made a merit of it.'
as NVex, I think justly observes,

this· ls rather careler s writing froni
the incongruity os ideas' m ‘'aperto
and‘ claudereturj' or it is a poor
conceit.

oppuynare ultro] The reading of
nearly all the MSS. is ‘oppugnasse
ultro: which it seems impossible to
translate in any probable manner.
In the text‘ oppugnare 'depends on
‘ad01ti.' Cf Liv. vi. 2, Castra
oppugnare adortus estz' and there
are many instances of this con-
struction.

Traces of these forts are still
visible in Perth and Fife, for they
were not those between the two
Friths.

‘Ultro‚' in Tacitus is osten a
difficult word to t1·sane]ate.1ts
meaning can best be learned by
looking at one or tuo ρηεειισεε where
it occurs. H. i. 71, ‘Celsus con-
stanter servatae erga Galbam fidei
crimen confessus exemplum ultro
im1›utavit;''that is, ‘Celsus was so
far from thinking his fidelity to
Galbam need of excuse, that, turn-
ing the tables on those who might
have been ready to accuse him, he

lum facess sit ultro damnatur.''

W hile endeavouring to imperil
another, he found thee tables turned,
and himself in danger. A. vi. 31,

N on despectum id apud barbaros,
ultroque potentiam habet.'' lt is
not looked down on by the bar-
barians3 indeed, the reverse is true:
it brings influence with it. From
these passages the force of ‘ultro'
is clearly seen, and how it d1ffers
from ‘sponte' which is simply
opposed to‘ invitus?

potius quam pellerentur] ‘ Po-
tius' is constructed here like‘ prius?
Cf Sall. Jug. 106, ‘Mansurum
potius quam morbo interiturae vitae
parceret. ’“ Also, A. i. 35, “Ille
moriturum poti'us' quam fidem exu-
eret clamitans.”

This ninth legion was the one
defeated under the command of
P. Cerialis, by the Britons, while
Paulinus was absent· in W ales. They
were afterwards recruited by le-
gionaries from Germany, although
their ranks were probabl) only par-

tially filled (A. xiv. 32. 38). The
