Inyuevouex, §el There seems no
possibility of success in the attempt
to arrange accuraiely the various
tribes under these heads. Nover-
theless, it may be true in the main,
that the Ingaevones are the nien of
the Ing-gau, i.e. the country os the
Angli, and synonymous therefore
with our nanie Eugland3 under
which view the Ingaevones would
represent the great Saxon confe-
deracy. The lsi-aevones (a vari-
ous reading for Istaevones) would
be the nien of the lsk district. or
the Franks ofa laterage. The Her-
miones again, or Herminones, for
there are both readings, would be
the army men, the high Gernians of
the South. (See Cambridue Essa) s,
1856, No. ἱ), on English Ethno-
logy‚ by the late Dr. nonaldfflu.)
Alarsos] The Marsi seen] to

¹ have once been settled in West-

phalia, between Munszer and I'ader-
born; but they withdrew further
into the interior, and occupied the
country between the Lippe aud the
Ruhr‚ or stili further souih. They
seem to have been concerned in
the affair of Varus and his legions,
and were severely punished by Ger-
manicus, who destroyed the famous
temple of Tauiana, situated near
their boundaries. (A. i. 51, ἃς.)
As they are not again mentioned hy
Tacitus, in his account of the various

C

tribes, they had perhaps ccased to
possess any separate exis-tenve.

Gauzbririij Strabo mentions this
people3 perhaps they :ue the sanie
as thesshaunavi in c. 33.

Vandulms] Originally this tribe
was settled on the northern coast of
Ger-many, in l'oincrania3 later they
were found near the Riesengebirge
(the Vandaliei Montes in Dion
Cassius, lv. 1), north of the Mar-
conian1; subsequently they oceu—
pied Pannonia and Diu-ia, and
about ΑΛ). 400 entered Spain.
Driven hence hy the Goths, they
crossed to Africa, aud were there
conquered by Justinian, A.D 534.

Germaniae] Tacitus does not
mean that the word itself was only
ret-ently used. lt seems to have
been known long before his tinie;
for in the Fasti Capitolini, for B.c.
22⁵2, they are mentioned apparently
as defeated with the lnsubrian
Gauls by the Roman consul Mar-
cellus. What he intends to say is,
that the nanie had only-1¹00ffl1tly
been given to the whole country,
liatviii'g’ previously ¹'been the de-
signation of a single tribe; just as
the Graeci, a tribe soinewhere in
the vicinity of the Achelousv even-
tually gave their naine to the whole
country of (Jreere.

Tuuyri—Germcmi] Yariousrnean-
ings have been assigned to the latter
oi' these words. Arm-(ling to some
they were called Germani, as true
Gauls, and brothers of the Kcltic
