nuper comilis] Compare Annals,
ii. 24. The chiefknowlcdge of Ger-
many possessed by the Romans was
gained, after the conquests of Julius
Caesar, from the expeditions of Do-
mitius Ahenobarbus (A. i. (ἰὸ, aud
iv. 44; Suetonius. Nero 4), and es-
pecially those of Nero Claudius
Drusus Germanicus, and his son
Caesar Germanicus. The former
was the first Roman general who
penetrated to the German Ocean (c.
34), probably by the Canal of Dru-
sus, from the northern arm of the
Rhine near Arnheim to the Sala
(Yssel) at Doesberg. Possihly he
may have reached the Amisia (Ems)
and subjugate-d the islands of the
coast. Subsequently he reached the
Visurgis (XVeser), but had to 1·etire;
afterwards he penetratcd into the
country of the Sues-i, and turning
his arms aflainst the Cherusci,
reached the Elbe, but without ad-
vancing further retired and soon
after died, Rc. 9.

Caesar Germanicus, after visiting
Germany on the destruction of Va—
rus and his legions, in conjunc-tion
with Tiberius, comment-ed a brilliant
career in that country. He crossed
the Rhine, and after crushing the
Marsi and Chatti‚on the organization
of a. revolt against the Romans by
Arminius, embarked in a flotilla,
and sailing hythe Lacus Flevus (Ζυγ-
dersee) to the ocean and up the Ems.
laid waste the country between that
river and the Lippe. ln the fol-
lowing year collectiug a fleet at the
Insula Batavorum, he sailed by the
Canal of Drusus and the Flevus to
the sea, and disembarking at Amisia
on the Etns, erossed that river and
the lVeser, and defeated Arminius.
On returning by the4Ems to the
ocean, the fleet was shattered by
terrific storms, and the soldiers dis-
persed along the coast. From these
stragglers, on their return, a good
deal of information‚ accompanied,

Rhenus Raeticarum Alpium inaccesso

according to Tacitus, with a good
deal of table. uas ult-aneu. Soon
after these eventS, Germanicus was
recalled, ΑΛ). 16. 111 Aa), 84, the
emperor Domitian undertook a
campaign against the Chatti, and
apparently with some trifling success;
but although Tacitus says ‘nuper
cognitis? he can hardly refer to this.
No doubt he used the word loosely,
referring to the campaigns mentioned ·
above: the date of which would be
from 80 to 100 years before the
publication of the Germania.

Rhenus] The ancient geogra-
puers-Strabo, for inztanee (iv. 3)
—made the Rhine rise in Mount
Adula. As this last author also
places the sources of the Addua
(Adda) in the same mountain, he
probably regarded thc- Upper Rhine
as the true river, and not the Lower
Rhine, which has a course less
directly northwnrds. Iu that case
the mountain would he the range
near the passes of the Splllgen, and
S. Bernardino, not the St. Go—
thard. The Raetian Alps, men-
tioned here, are the Grisons and
the Tyrol.

The name of the Rhine seems
only another form of Rhodanus,
and to be connected with Eridanus,
Danube, Don, Tanais, &a In this
view the name was a Keltic one,
siguifying the water, or [ἱνα-ς
perhaps originally the name for a
part of the river only, and used by
the Romans to designate the whole.

Alpium] This word apparently,
like Rhine and Danube, is of Keltic
origin: its root being ‘alb,' high,
the same word appetu-ing in Al—
bion, the hilly land, or Scotland,
and thence Great Britain generally.
At all events, the derivation, men-
tioned by Festus, from the Sabine
‘aluus' equivalent to the Latin
‘ albus: in the sense of white, snow—
cladlilnountains, does not seem worth
