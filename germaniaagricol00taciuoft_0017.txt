Of all the German tribes, the Suevi are the greatest and
most warlike. They are said to occupy a hundred cantons,
from each of which they draw a thousand fighting men every
year for service beyond the frontiers. The rest, remaining at
home, support themselves and the others; and in turn, during
the following year, are engaged under arms3 while the former
stay at home. By this arrangement agriculture and military
service proceed without interruption. They possess no private
or separate lands3 and are forbidden to remain more than a
year in the sa‘me place of abode. They use little corn, but

they are uncontrolled by the rules of duty or discipline, and
never do violence to their own inclinafions), their strength is
fostered, and their stature becomes enormous3 and even in the
coldest districts they have inured themselves to the absence of
all clothing, except skins, from the small size of which the
greater part of their body is exposed, and to bathe in their
rivers. They allow traders to visit them, rather in order to
have means of disposing of spoil taken in war, than from
any desire to have foreign articles introduced among-st thern.
Moreover, the Gennans do not use imported beasts of burden,
which the Gauls delight in, and procurc at high prices; their
native cattle, although small and ill-shaped, by daily exercise
are made capable of enduring extreme toil. In cavalry engage-
ments they oflzen leap down from their horses, and do battle
on foot, and they teach their horses to remain stationary: on
