praecipua sub Domitiano miseriarum pars erat, videre et
aspici: cum suspiria nostra subscriberentur: cum deno-
tandis tot hominum palloribus sufficeret saevus ille vultus

felix, Agricola, non vitae tantum claritate, sed etiam
opportunitate mortis: ut perhibent, qui interfuerunt

ment and oppression of the pro-
vincials. He was condemned, but
escaped punishment. Before Agri-
cola s death, this informer was him-

ἱ self in petil, and it was only after

his escape from retribution that he
broke out into his infamous course of
distinction.

Mon nostrae eju] Tacitus was
not at Rome for< some time subse-
quent to Agricola's death and he
only uses ''nosti-ae because he was
himself a senator. Helvidius Priscus
the younger, on the charge of having,
in a farce of Paris and Aenone, in-
tended to pourtray the Emperor's
divorce from all his wives, was appa-
rently seized in the senate, and
dragged off by the obsequious sena-
tors to prison.

Maurici Rusticique] Mauricus
was a brother to Arulenus Rusticus,
and banished when his brother r. as
put to death. Under Nerva he re-
turned. It was Mauricus who dis-

layed 1113 boldness by requesting
ffiomitian to display the Imperial
records,' 1η order to see what persons
had been guilty of infonning under
Nero, that they might know whom
to punish.

visus] This usually denotes the

' faculty of sight, but is used for

‘species' Cf. Liv. viii. 9, “Con-
spectus ab utraque acie augustior
humano xisu. Also, Liv. i. 20,

“Quaeque prodigia. fulminibus,
aliove visu missa susciperentur?
perfudit] Not literally for Se—
necio was not put to death in the
senate· house. The act stained the
senators with the guilt of innocent
blood. A verb must be supplied from
‘perfudit' to suit‘ visus, ‘horrore
perculit? or something of the kind.
εαόεενϋενειιίαν] Any bne who
supported an accusation brought by
another, by entering his name on the
indictment 33 subsidiary accuser, was
said ⁴ subscribere’ Cf. A. i. 74,
‘Quaestor postulavit, subscribente
Romano Hispone.'' There seems an
allusion to this in the use of the
word here, ‘were noted down as
matters of accusation against us.'
sufficeret saevus ille vultus] ‘ bore
up, without flinching, while marking
down for punishment the white
faces: &c. Cf. Cim-de Leg. Manil.
3, “ Una significatio litterarum cives
Romanos necandos trucidandosque
denotavit.''
rubor] Pliny the Younger (Pa-
neg. 48) speaks of Domitian, “fe-
mineus pallor in corpore, in ore im-
pudentia multo rubore suffusa.” Cf.
Suet. Domit. 18, ‘Vultu modesto,
ruborisque plenol'
pro virili portione] This phrase is
found also' ln H. iii. 20, in the sense

'pf‘ pro virili parte} which 13 Cicero s
