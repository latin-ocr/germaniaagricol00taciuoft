DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE. 43

morum partem magis laudaveris: nam prope soli bar-
barorum singulis uxoribus contenti sunt, exceptis
admodum paucis, qui non libidine, sed ob nobilitatem
plurimis nuptiis ambiuntur. Dotem non uxor marito,
sed uxori maritus offert. Intersunt parentes et propinqui,
ac munera. probant: munera non ad delicias muliebres
quaesita, nec quibus nova nupta comatur3 sed boves et
frenatum equum et scutum cum framea gladioque. In
haec munera uxor accipitur, atque invicem ipsa armorum

aliquid viro affert.

chapter, and is added to remove any
wrong inference that might be drawn
from them. The dress of the women
is scanty but it is a matter of cus-tom
only, and no pioof or cause of dis
soluteness of m01a1s‚as it might be
with a more refined people. A
similar case was that of the Sp ar-
tans. They were satirized by others
for the scanty clothing of then
women and yet thes e possessed a
character for propriety of conduct
above the average bf their country-
women.

ambiuntur] W hat this means is
clear from A. ii. 43, “donec ultro
ambiretur delatum ab Augusto con-
sulatum accipere.'' Caesar (i. 53)
mentions that Ariovistus, king of the
Suevi, had two wives. The Scan-
dinavi'an nations retained the same
custom, even long after they were
Christianized. and few habitsy prov ed
harder for the clergy to wced ont
from the people than this. the practice
lingering on as late as the tenth cen-
tur

gratem] Tacitus is contrasting here
the German custom with that of his
own eountrymen at Rome; but in
truth the difference seems one not
so much between different nations as
between the same nation in different
stages of civilization. When Medea
(l. 232) remarks that the destined
bride had to buy her sponse with a
vast sum of money, the Scholiast
observes that Euripides was trans-
ferring to heroic times the usage of
his own day. In most natione, in

their early pcriods, the bridegroom
appears to have paid for his wife. ln
patriarchal days Shechem offered to
Dinah s father and buthren as much
dowrx as they r,equircd on condition
of tlieir giving him the damsel to
wife (Gen xxxiv. 12). Homer at-
tests the existence of the custom in
early Greece, speaking of a hundred
beeves, and a thousand sheep and
oats, as the price for a wife.. The
faws of the early Saxons recognize
the continuance of the same practice.
As civilization however advances,
and the‘ onera matiimonii' become
more sensibly felt, this custom dis-
appears and is replaced by the oppo-
site; a change which, in the e) es of
the Greek and Roman satiiists, at
least wrought no gieat amount of
good. to judge from their complaints
of the pride and waywardness of
largely-dowered dames. The Ger-
mans, then in giving dowries for
their wives only resembled other
half- eivilized 1·;aces but they were
no doubt to a great extent peculiar
in the regard they paid them after-
w·;ards although it does not seem to
have prevcnted them f1 om devolving
a good deal of hard w·01k upon them,
like most other barbarous natione.

In haec munera] The preposition
here seems to me to have pretty
nearly, its usual signification of
‘into: the future husband arte
with the articles given, and fil s up
the gap made in his possessione by
taking a wife.
