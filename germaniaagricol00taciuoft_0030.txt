DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE.

ac praecipiti vertice ortus, modico flexu in occidentem
versus, septemtrionali Oceano miscetur. Danubius, molli
et elementer edito montis Abnobae jugo effusus, pluresv
populos adit, donec in Ponticum mare sex meatibus

erumpat:

septimum enim os paludibus hauritur.

II. Ipsos Germanos indigenas crediderim, minimeque

modicofleaeu] This is sometimes
referred to the head of the river
between Bregenz and Βῖ11ος 1110
objection to 11111111 view is that the
tuin is any thing but mode1ate,
being all 11111 111100111 11051, whereas
1110110111 modi cus' seems to imply
a gradual sweep w estwmald It 101015,
110 doubt, to the portion of the 11101·
11 mg between Art uacum (Arnheim),
and'Lugdunum Batavorum (Ley-
den).

Danuln'zcs] As stated above, under
Rhenus, the derivation of this word
seems the Keltic Don, or Dan,
water. The upper p01tion of the
stream, as far as Vienna, commonly
went 111· 11115 1101110; below that
town lster was the usual term.
According to Adelung, Danubius
is equiva'ent to the upper water,
and (Dan)ister, the lower water.

Abnobae] This is the range of
the Seliwarzwald, or Black Forest‚
extending from the Oberland of
Baden to ειῬ1011ι110111η 011 1110 eastern
ᾱο0111··111 of which, at a height of
01101113ὓο0 feet, are the sources of
the Danube

plures populos] Beginning at the
head of the river, aud advan‹-ing
eastward, there would be the Vin-
delici, Norici. Pannonii, and Maesi,
on the right bank: on the left 1110
occupants of the Decumates Agri,
Narisci, Marcomani, Quadi, and
Daci; the river being divided
between the Kehic, Teutonic‚ and

Slavonic raceS.

Sea* meatibus] The ancients were
not agreed upon the number of the
mouths of the Danube. Herodotus
(iv. 47) mentions five· Pliny
(iv. 24), six; Strabo (1·11. 3), seven;
and Mela (ii l), the same, four

only being navigable. There are
still seven mouths, of which the
Salina mouth is of the greatest
importance.

erumpat] There is another read-
ing here. ⁵ erumpit ς’ and it is worth
one's while 1ο note the differ-enee
between 1110 11νο expressions. ‘ Do-
nec,' meaning ‘ until,' is used with
the indicative to convey the ex-
pression of some actual fact: as
iu A. 1.5, 11111111 vulgabahtur
donec excessisse Augustum sama
eadem 111111.”·1)οῃεο with the
subjunctive is us 5011 when 1110 event
is not stated positively, but only
contemplated as a future con-
tingent-y, A. i. 3'2, “eo usque
flagitatus est 110110(- 011 exitium
dederetur. ' The differeuce between
the two cas 05 seems in some degree
analos-vous to that 1101110011ἐωςηλθεν
and ’ἕως (ἓν ἔλθῃ in Gr.eek One
easily sees how this last sense merges
into the notion of an end con-
templated by the agent, and pro-
posed to himself as his aim; and
this seems the view to be taken of
this passage, and a similar one in
A. ii. 6, ** Rhenus Germaniam
praevehitur donec Oceano miscea-
tur.'' Here ‘donec 0111011111.ἱ or
‘miscetur,' would 010011’*11111ἰ1 it
actually enters the sea3 ‘donec
erumpat? or ‘misceatur,' 15 ‘until
such time as it 511011 suceeed in
its aim of forcing its way to the sea?

ΙΙ. imz’iyenasl ‘ lntligena'is derived
from ‘ indu,5 a form of‘in.' still found
in ‘ induperator ’ for ⁵ imperator,' and
‘ gigno) To be thus αὐτόχθονες was
a matter of boast amongst the an-
cients. Cf.Arist.Vesp. 1076. Thucyd.
ii. 36. As far as the Gennans are
