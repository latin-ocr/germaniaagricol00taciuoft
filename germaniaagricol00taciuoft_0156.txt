multitudinem, proelium poscentem, in hunc modum

XXX. “Quotiens causas belli et necessitatem nos-
tram intueor, magnus mihi animus est, hodiernum diem,
consensumque vest-runi, initium libertatis totius Britan-
niae fore. Nam et universi servitutis experteS, et nullae Α
ultra terrae, ac ne mare quidem securum, imminente
nobis classe Romana: ita proelium atque arma, quae
fortibus honesta, eadem etiam ignavis tutissima sunt.
Priores pugnae, quibus adversus Romanos varia fortuna
certatum est, spem ac subsidium in nostris manibus habe-
bant: quia nobilissimi totius Britanniae, eoque in ipsis
penetralibus siti, nec servientium litora aspicientes, oculos
quoque a contactu dominationis inviolatos habebamus.
Nos, terrarum ac libertatis extremos, recessus ipse ac
sinus famae in hunc diem defendit: nunc terminus
Britanniae patet: atque omne ignotum pro magnifico est.

a Romanized form of ‘ Gald Cachah,'
‘ Gald, the fighter of battles 2' just as
an Argyll duke was called John Du
Nan Cach, Black-haired John, the
battle-lighter.

XXX. causas belli <3ch The
motivcs for the war are our deter-
mination to drive away slavery from
Caledonia z our necessity, the fact
that we are driven into a corner by
the avarice and thirst for power dis-
played by the Romans, from which
we have no escape.

in nostris manibus] Tacitus means
that the Brstons, when defeated in
previous battleS, always had the Cal e-
donians to fall back on as a kind of
reserve. Now the rescrve itself was
going into action.

eoque in ipsae penetralibus] Cf.
Caes. v. 12, “ Britanniae pars interior
ab iis incolitur quos natos in insula
ipsa memoriae proditum dicunt3
maritima pars ab iis qui praedae ac
belli inferendi eausa ex Belgis trans-
ierant.'' The last, inhabitants of
the coast opposite Gallia and Bel-
gica, might be said to have their eyes
accustomed to the sight of slavery.

terraram ew libertatis extremos]

They were situated at the edge of
the habitable world, and were the last
remnant not yet enslaved by Rome.

recessus ipse ccc sinusfimzae] ⁸ Si-
nus' seems used here in the same
way as in Cicero's phrase, “in philo-
sophiae sinum quum nostra voluntas
studiumque nos compulisset.'' Cal-
gacus represents Fame as cherishing
the Caledonians, like petted children,
in her lap. They had up to this
time been secure from aggression for
two reasons ς first, because they
divelt in a remote corner of the earth,
and were hard to get at (‘ recessus
ipse ’); and, secondly, because Fame
had made much of them, and bruited
abroad their bravery‚ to the terror of
aggressors. Lipsius explains ‘ sinus
famae' to be ‘the corner of fame:
meaning that the people in their
distant fastnesses were little known
to fame. But the Caledoniam, one
would think, would hardly thus de-
scribe themselves.

omne iynotmn ἕνῃ] Cf. Thucyd.
vi. ll, Τὰ ’γὰρ διὰ πλείστου ’πάν-
τες ’ἴσμεν θαυμαζόμενα καὶ τὰ
πεῖραν ἥκιστα ’τῆς δόξης δόντα.
