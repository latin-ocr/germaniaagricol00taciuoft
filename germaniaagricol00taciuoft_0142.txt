AGRICOLAE VITA.

cola, quanquam transvecta aestas, sparsi per provinciam
numeri, praesumpta apud militem illius anni quies, tarda
et contraria bellum inchoaturo, et plerisque custodiri

contractisque legionum vexillis et modica auxiliorum

culo esset, erexit aciem: caesaque prope universa gente,

sparsi per provinciam numeri]
‘Numerus' is used for a body of
soldiers of any magnitude. Cf. H.
i. 6, and 87. Suetonius (Vesp. 6)
has ‘vocatis ad numerum officiis.'
⁸ Numerilegionum ' are therefore the
maniples, cohorts, &c

tarda et contraria] These words
are in apposition to the previous
sentence, ‘all points adverse,' διο.
Cf. A. xvi. 8, “Praeficeretque
rationibus et libellis et epistolis
libertos, inania simul et falsa.'' So
in Euripides' line Ἑλένην κτανῶμεν
Μενελέῳ λύπην πικράν.

custodiri suspecta potius videbatur]
This ought not to be translated
‘ Most were rather of opinion that
the suspected points should be
watched,' as though ‘custodiri'
were put for‘custodienda esses ⁸ Po-
tius‘ is really an adjective, not an
adverb; and the sentence means,
‘it seemed a better plan sor the
suspected points to be watche-(l)

contractisque leyz'onum veaeillis]
There is considerable doubt as to
the exact meaning of these words.
The common view is that the “ vex-
illa' consisted of the veterans who,
after a certain length of service, were
released from their oath, but retained
until their full discharge under a
‘vexillum,' free from the usual
military duties, but called into
service on special emergencies. Cf.
A. i. 36, “Exanctorari qui sena
dena (stipendia) fecissent, ac retineri
sub vexillo, immunes nisi propul-

sandi hostis.'' There would be a
certain number of these (perhaps
500, from Α. iii. 21) attached to
each legion, and they might act in-
dependenti)⁷ of their own legions, οι·
several ⁸ vexilla' be joined together,
asin H. ii. 83. lt does not how-
ever follow that ‘ vexilla' are the
sanie as ‘ vexillarii? It may deuote*
bodies of troops dctached from their
own legions, and serving apart from
them when occasion required. Cer-
tainly such phrases as ‘ vexillum
tironum ' and ⁴ equitnm ' (A. ii. 78,
and H. ii. ll). and ‘vexilla delecto-
rum* (A. xv. 26), seem to favour this
view. I am inclined to think that
when Tacitus uses ‘ vexillum ' with· -
out any explanation, as ‘ vexilla
legionum‚' ‘tertiae decumae legionis
vexillum,' &c., he :illudes to the
veteran soldiers first mentioned.
When he does not mean these, he
adds some explanation. such as ⁸ tiro-
num,' ‘equitum,' &e to show that he
is speaking of other bodies of men
under a flag.

erexit aciem] ‘Erigere' is nsed
osmarching troops up hill. Cf. Liv.
i. 27, ‘ Erigit totam aciem,' and iii.
18, ‘ In clivum Capitolinum erigunt
amem.

prout prima cessissent, eje] This
is a favourite remark ot* Tacitus.
He repeats it H. ii. 20, “ Gnarus ut
initia belli provenissent, famam in
cetera fore;'' and A. xii. 31, “Ille
gnarus primis eventibus metum aut
fiduciam gigni.''
