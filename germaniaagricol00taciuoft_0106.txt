92 INTRODUCTION.

That illustrious emperor, long anxious to attest by the results of
war the veracity of his descriptions of this country, will soon
convey in triumphal procession the visible proofs of his truth-
fulness. According to our present information, Britain lies
between the North and the West, facing the mouths of the
Rhine3 its coast lines forming an obtuse angle in that direction.
It then slopes away, one side lying opposite Gaul, the other
Germany. Again, closed in, as it were, behind by an uninter·
rupted line of even coast, forming angles at the extremities of
the other two sides, it assumes a triangular shape, very much
resembling Sicily in form; it is flat, large, adapted rather to the
support of cattle than men 3 it is full of woods, lakes, and huge
rivers, whose waters alternately flow into the sea, and retire
from it. In some of these, pearls and precious stones are fmmd.
The various tribes, under the rule of kingS, occupy the island;
but they are all uncivilized, and the further they are removed
from the mainland of Europe, the more they are destitute of any
wealth except cattle and lands. They stain their bodies with
woad, either because they like‘the look of it, or for other reasons.
They are continually at war one with the other, from their
eagerness to extend their rule and possessions. In battle they
not only employ cavalry and infantry, but chariots drawn by
two horses3 their own arms resembling those of the Gauls.
These chariots, whose axle-trees are fitted with scythes, are
called ⁴ covini?
