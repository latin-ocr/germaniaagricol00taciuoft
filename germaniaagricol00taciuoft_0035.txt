DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE.

III. Fuisse ‘apud eos

et Herculem memorant ;

primumque omnium virorum fortium ituri in proelia

canunt.

Sunt illis haec quoque carmina, quorum relatu,

quem Bar-ditum vocant, accendunt animos futuraeque
pugnae fortunam ipso cantu augurantur: terrent enim,

men generally. Presently these
tribes themselves saw their advan-
tage in adopting tbe same name,
as it invested them at once with a
formidable prestige. In this view
‘ob metum' is equis-alent to ‘ut
metus Gallis injiceretur.'

III. Herculem] See the note on
the German deities in c. 9.

Ilaec quoqne carmina] These songs
in honour of Hercules. aud other
heroes (cf. A. ii. 88, “Arminius
canitur adhuc barbaras apud gen-
tes”)‚ chanted before entering into
battle, to inflame the eourage of the
wan-iore, are to be distinguished
from the purely mythological poenis,
mentioned in c. 2..‘·celebrant car-
minibus antiquis,'' ἃς.

Ritter makes a difficulty about
the words ⁸ quem Bai-dirum vocant:
on the ground that these songs
were evidently sung by the whole
line of fighting men. (Cf. H. iv,
18, and ii. 2¹2.) l do not see much
in this ; sor while the Scaldschautffll,
the meu, if the songs were familiar,
?'⁹.¹h.‘'‘y often would be, might easily
om in.

J relatu] This word only occurs in
Tacitus, instead of the usual form
² ‘relatio;' cf. A. xv. 22. H. i. 30:
although about the former passage
there may be some doubt.

Barditum] The usual name for
a poet in the Germanic tongues
was ‘scop,' and in the Scandinavian
‘scald2' while the word ‘harditus'
is of Keltic origin. If so, the Ger-
mans can hardly be thought to have
designated a native custom by a
foreign term. The practice of
course existed amnngst thern, as
well as amongst the Kelts; and 1
think it probable that 'l'acitus de-
rived his information in this respect

through a Kclxic source. and con·
sequently the practice of the Ger-
mans, resembling as it did t'nat of
the Gauls‚ was not uunaturally de—
scribed by his insormexs in words
familiar to their ears, as descriptive
of their own custom. Lucan, i. ⁴47,
mentions these Keltic bards εψ

 

“ Vos quoque
Plurima securi fudistis carmina
Bardi.

Certe populi quos despicit
Arctos

Felices errore suo, quos ille
timorum

Maximus, haud urget lethi metus;
inde ruendi

In ferrum mens prona viris,
animaeque capaces

Mortis, et lunarum rediturae
parcere vitae.''

 

This custom was retained by the
Svandinavian natione. Hacon, Earl
of Norway, in oue of his battles,
is said to have been attended by
five Scalds, each of whom sangari
ode to inspirit the tvm-riom before
the fray begam and the verses,
chanted by the Scalas of Olavc
King of Norway in battle, have
been preserved. .

futuraeque paviae] This idea of
divining the result of a battle from
the character of the shouts raised
by the two armies before engaqing,
existed amongst the Highlanders.
At the battle of Killicrank1e‚ Ca-
meron declared tobis rnen that the
battle would be gained because their
shouts were more lively than those
of their opp‹›nents‚-—¹t prediction. as
it happened, vcrified. (See Aikin
on the passage.)
