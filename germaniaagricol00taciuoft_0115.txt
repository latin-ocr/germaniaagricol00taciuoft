an end to his life.

pueritiam adolescentiamque] The
usual divisions of age amongst the
Romans are as follows :—‘ infantia'
lasted from one year to seven3
‘pueritia' from seven to fourteen;
‘adolescentia’ from fourteen to
twenty-eight3 and ‘juventus' from
this last date to about fifty. This
is the account of Isidorus (Orig.
xi. 2). Varro, gives the limits
rather differently.

peccantium] Tacitus is rather
fond of this absolute use of the par-
ticiple in the sense of a noun. Cf.
Dialog. de Orat. 6, ‘vulgata dicen-
tium gaudia.' Cf. the same Dia-
logne, c. 13. 20. 28. 41.

Massilmm habuerit] Lipsius cor—
rected this to ‘ habuerat) In support
of the indicative there are passages
in the Annals (i. 14), “ Quominue
idem pro Druso postularetur ea
causa quod designatus consul Dru-
sus praesensque erat;'' and (i. 16),
“Nullis novis causis nisi quod mu-
tatus princeps licentiam turbarum
ostendebat.” On the other hand,
the subjunctive is also fonnd; as
(A. i. 19), “Profecto juvene, mo-
dicum otium; sed superbire miles
quod filius legati orator publicae
causae satis ostenderet.” - nd also
(H. ii. 95), “Laetum foedissimo
cuique apud bonos invidiae fuit,
quod exstructis in Campo Martio
aris inferias Neroni fecisset.'' The
difference between the two forms
seems to be this: the indicative
aster ‘quod' states a reason as ex-

isting absolutely; the subjunctive
areason existing in the opinion of
the speaker, or supposed speaker.
If ‘ habuerit ' be retained, the sense
would be that, in Agricola's view,
his education at Massilia kept him
out of mischicf. If ⁴ habuerat* be
read, Tacitus puts forward the state-
ment as a certain fact3 and one
would rather, Ι think, have ex-
pected this last reading. Massilia
seems to have had a great educa-
tional reputation. Augustus (A. iv.
44) sent his sister ‹)ctavia·s grand·
son there into polite banishment,
under pretence ofstu‹1y; and Strabo
remarks that, in his day, illustrious
Romans osa liter-ary turn frequented
Massilia instead of visiting Athens.
Tacitus describes the place as dis-
tinguished for Greek politeness,
because it was founded by a. colony
of Phocaeans.

vti-tium] For this use of ‘ mixtus:
cf. A. vi. 51, ‘Inter bona malaque
mixtus ς’ and Sall. Jug. 57, ‘Tae-
dam pice et sulphure mixtam.’

Romano ac senatori] A Roman
senator was a person whose main
business lay in action, not in spe-
culation. Τοο great indulgence
therefore in philosophical studies
was thought prejudicial, as tending
to foster a dreamy unpractical cha-
racter. The sanic. idea prevailed
amongst the Greeks. Cf. Plato,
Gorg. 484 c.

hausisse] This seems an instance
of the construction, mentioned in
c. 1, in the note, ‘at nnnc . . . .
tempora ·,' the ¹ hausisse· being only
