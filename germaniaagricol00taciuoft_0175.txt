AGRIOOLAE VITA. 159

modestiam, si industria ac vigor adsint, eo laudis ex‘ffm

usum, ambitiosa morte inclaruerunt. ‘ carolum Immo aa}
XLIII. Finis vitae ejus nobis luctuosus, amicis tristis,
extraneis etiam ignotisque non sine cura fuit. Vulgus
quoque, et 'hic aliud agens populus, et ventitavere ad
domum, et per fora et Circulos locuti sunt : nec quisquamxmtfff
audita, morte Agricolae, aut laetatus est aut statimtufflss
oblitus est. Augebat miserationem constans rumor,
veneno interce tum. Nobis nihil comperti adfirmare
amipper omnem valetudinem ejus, crebrius,
quam ex more principatus per nuntios visentis, et liber-
torum primi, et medicorum intimi venere: sive cura illud

malis principibus magnos viros esse: obsequiumque aab&

Agricola either by blood or close
friendship.

aliud ayens] ‘Agere aliquid' is
used by the Latin writers in the
sense of making any thing one's
business. ‘Hoc agite, o Juvenes,'
‘make this your aim ς’ ⁴ Hoc agit ut
doleas* (Juv. v. 157), ‘his great

the empire, and are inclined to
despise all who lower their aspirations
to the merely possible.

eo laudis earcedere] ‘Excedo' is
gengtrally {sed dfor *ρδῗείῗὲ bey02n4d
Pilati-{33} ἱΙΙῗιυεῐῖαῗῖἐε novitate elthag3
nitudine excessit? Also, Liv. xxxiii.

35, ⁸ Ne in altercationem excederet
res.' It perhaps may be used here
for exceedlng the usual bounds in a
pregnant sense: ‘pass the usual limits
to an extent of p1·aise,' διο.

quo plerique ...... inclaruerunt]
This is put for ‘ quo claritudinis per-
venerunt,' or ‘ quo inclarescentes
pervenerunt) In this way, ‘ per ab·
rupta' comes in appropriatel y. Trans-
late, ‘ a. height of glory others have
reached, by travelling along a rugged
path, and without any advantage to
the state (earning distinction) by an
aspir-ing death.' The whole sen-
tence is excessively awkward, and I
think, corrupt. ¹

XLIll. eatraneis etiam] In A.
iv. ll, ‘ extraneus' is used as opposed
to a man's ‘filius' So Suetonius
Claud. 4, “ Ne heredem quidem
nisi inter tertios ac paene extraneos
nuncuparit.'' Here, therefore, it does
not mean ‘ foreigners} but only
persons who were unconnected with

object is to annoy you! Here ‘ aliud
agens' means generally busy on ver?r
different objects; not concerned wit ι
such matters as the doings and fates
ofillustrious men. Juvenal says of
the people in his day, “ex quo suf
fragia nulli vendimus, effudit curaS.''

et per sora] There were several
of these at Rome, three especially
used for public business ς the Forum
Romanum, the Forum Julii (Suet.
Jul. Caes. 26), the Forum Augusti
(Suet. Octav. 29). Others were sub—
sequently added by other emperors.
There was one begun by Domitian,
and completed by Nerva, the ‘ Forum
Trajani,' διο.

eae ‘more principatus] This custom
here alluded to is not stated to be
peculiar to Domitian. All Empe-
rors send persons to make inquiries
rather than make them in person3
and as generally it is a formal com-
pliment, the inquiries are rarely
made frequently.
