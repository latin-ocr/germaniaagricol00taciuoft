These, holding swords in their hands, advanced through the
camp to meet the captive& and after decorating them with
crowns led them to a brazen bowl, raised on steps. Mounting

open, after inspecting the entrails, announced victory to their
friends. In the contests they beat hides, stretched on the wicker
bodies of their chariots, so as to make a prodigious noise.

running for a considerable distance in a compact body, and
flowing in a clearly-defined channel, it separates into various
streams at no great distance from the ocean. The river, towards

banks recede, and the stream is no longer a river, but a vast
lake, filling the plains, under the name of Flevo3 and after
encircling an island of the same name, it again contracts, and
enters the ocean under the form of a river. From this point to
the Alps Germany is bounded by its banks, on the South by
the Alps, 011 the East by the neighbouring tribes of Sarmatia,
on the Northern frontier by the ocean. Its inhabitants are
savage in spirit and uncouth in form, and in addition to their
natural fierceness, they heighten their courage by warfare, and
