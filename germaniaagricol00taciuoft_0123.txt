Aquitaniae praeposuit, splendidae in primis dignitatis ad-

ministratione ae spe consulatus, cui destinarat.

IX. inter patricios ascivit] In
AJ). 74 Vespasianus and his son
Titus were appointed Censors, the
last who held that office. They en-
deavoured to recruit the ranks of the
Patricians, thinned by a long series
of cruelties and deaths, few having
survived of those l’atrician families
who in the early days of Rome formed
her sole burghers or citizens. At the
end of the Republic there were only
some fifty of these familie-s left.
Julius Caesar therefore, by the ‘lex
cassia: raised many plebeians to that
rank (Suet. Jnl. Caes. 41). Au-
gustus and Claudius did the same,
but under Vespasianus they had
again dv2v-i5ndled down to 200 families

( Aquitan)1'‹1e] This was one of
Caesar's three divisious of Gallia,
but it was afterwards enlarged, and
embraced the country between the
Cevennes, the Loire, Garonne, and
Pyrenees. A trace of its name is
supposed to be retained in Guienne.

splendidae . . . diffititaiis] This
is a genitive of quality. like ‘⁴ mater
Procilla fuit rarae castitatis'' (c. 4),
loosely descriptis-e of the province of
Aquitania, or more correctly of the
office of its ruler. This dignity was
twofold; consisting absolutely in the
government of so extensive and irn-

terrarum partem'), and, in the next
place, in the probability of its ruler
being elevated to the Consulship.
The nominative case to ⁴ destinarat '
is ‘ provincia‚' not ⁴ Vespasianus ς’ the
splendoni- osa province could hardly

be affected by the isolated fact that
the Emperor thought of making
Agricola Consul ; whereas ifitsmlers
were as a matter of general routine
usually made Consuls, this would
add to its splendour considerably.
Nevertheless the term ‘destinarat'
does strike one as odd. Perhaps the
pluperfect is used. because as com-
pared with the actual administration
this hope of the Consulate was an-
terior to it. The province was splen-
did from its actual government, and
even before that, from the hope of
the Consulate marked out for its ruler
in any particular case, from the very
moment of his nomination.

secura et obtusior-1 ‘Securus' is
used here rather cnriously: it seems
to imply a rough and ready sort of
justice, a justice not troubliug itself
overmuch about legal subtleties, but
founded on broad principles ofequity.
‘ Obtusus ' is used ofany thing bruised
(ι tundo') until the fine edge is gone.
Lucretius (iv. 356) observes that a
square tower at a distance looks
round, “ angulus obtusus quia longe
Cernitur omnis ;” the sharp outline
is destroyed by distance. Here it
means ‘ blunt,' ‘unrefined.'

plura manu osseus] ‘Agere manu ’
is equivalent to · vi ἣξει-εξ to do
,things with a strong hand.

quami-is intrr toyatosl ‘ Togati '
are civilians, the 'toga' being the
dress of peace, as distinguished from
‘ sacrum,¹ the soldier‘s cloak (cf. Cic.
Philsiii. ll ). The reference here is to
the assizcs held under the governor's
presfflency, generally in the winter
months, when the army had gone
