CAII CORNELII TACITI

DE SITU, MORIBUS, ET POPULIS GERMANIAE
LIBELLUS.

Ι. GERMANIA omnis a Gallis Raetisque et Pannoniis,
Rheno et Danubio fluminibus, a Sarmatis Dacisque,

I. Germania] The country in-
tended by Tacitus is Germania
east of the Rhine, sometimes called
Trans-rhenana, Magna, or Barbara.
Distinet from this was Ge1mania
Cis-rhenana, a district west of the
Rhine, occupied by transplanted
Germanic trich. This was sub-
divided into Germania Prima, or
Superior, extending from Augusta
Rauracorum (Augst), a little above
Bffle, to Moguntiacum (Mainz),
and Germania Secunda or Inferior,
reaching from this last point to the
sea. These two divisions are com-
prehended in the plural form Ger-
maniae, used by Tacitns (A. ii. 73).
The area, embraced under the name
Germania, by our author, is larger
than that included in its modern
equivalent, Germany. It extended
from the Rhine to the Vistula and
the Carpathian mountains3 and
from the Baltic to the. Danube:
thus comprising Mecklenburg‚ Po-
memma, VVest Prussia, Brandcn-
burg, Saxony, Bohemia, Poland‚
Silesia, Denrnark, chdcn, &c. In
fact, according to the view of
Tacitus, Get-many was the entire
country occupied by German races.
In placing thcse so far cast of the

Bibe, he was, I think, clearly in
err0r3 at which one can hardly be
Stirpi-ised, considering how scanty
his means of information nith re-
spect to these regions and people
must have been. There is little
doubt that the population in this
quartcr was Slavonic, not Ge1·man;
for the older the names of the
rivers, mountains, ἀει, of this re-
gion, the more surely they are
Slavoni03 and there is certain evi-
dence that between the ninth and
tenth centuries after Christ these
countries were mainly occupied by
that race. In the entire absence
of any record of the expulsion of
the Germanic peoples by them, this
is fair ground for inferring similar
occupancy at the time of Tacitus.
omnis] i.e. ‘Gerinany entire,'
as distinguished from the two pro-
vinces of Germania Superior and
Inferior, regarded as detached frag-
ments, dislocatcd from the true
German area. So Caesar speaks of
‘Gallia omnis' (B. G. i. l), as dis-
tinguished from Cisalpine Gaul.
The order here, and in the passage
just quoted, is worth noticing3 *the
name of the country to be described
