82 DE MORIBUs GERMANIAE.

insigne superstitionis, formas aprorum gestant. Id pro
armis omniumque tutela: securum deae cultorem etiam
inter hostes praestat. Rarus ferri, frequens fustium usus.
Frumento ceterosque fruetus patientius, quam pro solita
Germanorum inertia, laborant. Sed et mare scrutantur;
ac soli omnium succinum, quod ipsi Glesum vocant, inter
vada atque in ipso litore legunt. N ec quae natura quaeve
ratio gignat, ut barbaris, quaesitum compertumve. Diu
quin etiam inter cetera ejectamenta maris jacebat, donec
luxuria nostra dedit nomen: ipsis in nullo usu3 rude

and the form Borussi for the Prus-
sians connects them with the British
more easily. 'she real language of
these people would be Lithuanic.

formas aprorum] These were no
doubt small iuiages of boars, worn
round the person as amulets or
charms.

omniumque tutela] This use of
the genitive is explained by a phrase
in c. 46, “nec infantibus ferarum
imbriumque suffugium quam ut in
aliquo ramorum connexu contegan-
tur.'' The phrase therefore means
protection against every thing, and
there is no need to read ⁸ omni‚' on
the authority of oue manuscript.

securum] This of course does not
mean ‘ secure* in oursense of the word,
(that would be ‘tutus,') butfree from
apprehension. Cf. Horace i. 26,
‘Quls sub Arcto Rex gelidae me-
tuatur orae, Quid Tiridatem terreat,
unice Securus.'' Cf. also H. iii. 41,
“apud avidos periculorum et dede-
coris securos :'' careless‚that is‚of any
disgrace that might follow. Tutus
means ‘safe from 'naum ;’ which is not
the same thing as being free from the
apprehension of harm, so that a man
may very well be ‘tutus,' and not
‘ securuS,⁸ and vice versa.

laborant] This transitive use of
the word is poeticalz it occurs in
Horace, Ep. 5. 60, ‘⁸ Quale non per-
fectius nit-ae laborarint manus.''
Propertius has the same construc-
tion, “ Noctibus hibernis castrensia
pensa laboro‚” and Quinctiliau also
uses it.

quaere ratio yr'ynat] There is
another reading, ‘gip-vnit,v and be-
tween the nieanings of the two there
is a difference. The indicative assei-ts
that the cause of the production of
amber well known to others, is un-
known to the barbarians: the sub-
junctivo states that the barbarians
have never inquii-ed into the cause,
whatever it may be, of its production.
There can here be no doubt that
‘ gignat ⁹ is the true reading.

ὑπανίει nostra] Amber was used
in various ways hythe Romans for
ornamenting drinking-cups (JuV. V.
38, ‘Heliadum crustas‚' δια), for
bracelets and necklaces. Balls of
amber were also carried by the Ro-
man ladies in their hands, for the
sake of the agreeable perfume given
out by it when rubbed. Cf. Mart.
There is an
epigram of the same writer (iv. 59),
on the fact mentioned below of in-
sects being enclosed in the amber.

This amber is really a resinous
exudation from beds of lignite pro-
duced underground, and chiefly
thrown up by the sea between Ko-
ningsberg and Memel. It is gene-
rally found in small pieces, but
sometimes in large niasses of fifteen
or sixteen pounds⁴ It consists of
resins, a volatile oil. and a bitumi-
nous body, the chief ingredient being
carbon. It is found also on the
Eastern coast of England and Sicily.
It reached Rome by an overland
route, being brought by the inhabit-
ants of the Baltic coast into Pan-
