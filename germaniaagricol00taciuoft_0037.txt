DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE. 23
populos nullis aliis aliarum nationum connubiis infectos,.
propriam ei: sinceram et tantum sui similem gentem
exstitisse arbitrantur. Unde habitus quoque corporum,
quanquam in tanto hominum numero, idem omuibus:
truces et coerulei oculi, rutilae comae, magna corpora et
tantum ad impetum valida: laboris atque operum notu

eadem patientia: minimeque sitim aestumque tolerarer
frigora atque inediam caelo solove adsueverunt.

never had their national type. altered
for the worse by intermarriages with
other natione, in various directions,

mentatore brine some passages to
show that ‘inficio' and ⁴ vitio' do
not always imply a change for the
worse. I think however that here
Tacitus certainly does mean that
any intel-mixture of blood would
make the race deteriorate.

sinoeram] The word is used here
in its original sense, ⁶ without admix-
ture' or ¹· alloyz' apparently derived
from the notion of honey free from
any admixture of wax.

truces et coerulei] This fierceness
of aspect was a peculiarity of the
Germana mentioned to Caesar by
the Gauls and Roman traders (Caesar
i. 39, ‘⁴ sese ne vultum quidem atque
aciem oculorum ferre potuisse''). The
physical features here mentioned are
often alluded to by the Roman
writers: ⁶· Coerula quis smpuit Ger-
mani lumina? flavam caesariem et
madido torquentem cornua cirro,''
JuV. xiii. 164. Horace mentions
one os them (Ep. xvi. 7), ‘⁸ Nec fera
eoeruleadomuitGe1·maniapube.” Cf.
also Agricola ll. The Germans en-
deavoured to increase the redness of

The prevalcnce of these physical
features (although they are still pre-
served to a considerable extent, es-
pecially amongst the. people of the
hishlands of middle Germany, and
the adjoining borders of the northern
lowlands) is by no meam, in our
day, universal amongst the Germans :
nex-crthcless. as compared with the
dark complexione and hair of Italy,
these descriptions of them were no
doubt truc: besides which the type
of the rave may have been materially
altered by intermixture with other
nations.

muyna corpora] Strabo (vii. l)
says the Germans were birgger men
than the Kelm, although these last
were always ‹eonsidered amuch taller
rave than the Italians. Sidonius
Apollinaris makes ajoke about the
Muses semning a metre of six feet
when the patrous of her verse were
sex-en fect high.

laboris] Caesar (vi. ⁶21) says the
Germans ⁸ labori ae duritiae stndent3'
by this he means probably that they
were trained up to undergo toil and
hardshin in war. 'sancitus on the
other hand, implies that they were
unable to bear proti-acted work.
