130 AGRICOLAE VITA.

victos continuisse: ne laureatis quidem gesta prosecutus
est: sed ipsa dissimulatione famae famam auxit, aesti-

mulque doctus per aliena experimenta, parurn profici

provinciam regere. Nihil per libertos servosque pub-

aut precibus centurionum milites ascire, sed optimum

exsequi. parvis peccatis veniam, magnis severitatem

‘Ad vanum et

Hence

it means, by a natural consequence,
‘ 11111100,ἱ 33 * Vanus auctor absumpti
Masiniss sae. ' ‘ Vanitas ' is therefore
opposed by Cicero to‘ veritas? It
then iniplies the habit of doing or
31111ος any thing, irrespective ot its
triith? to biing ”oneself into notice.
Cf. H. iii. 73,* *·Η1111113 honoris et
suamet vanitate monstratum, quod
edicta in populum pro Vespasiano
magnifica, probrosa adversus Vitel-
lium jece1·.''at This is the sens e

somewhat different from our 110111

has the notion of pxiding oneself on

attached to it,—an idea which lies
at the root of * vanitas?

oze laureatis quidem] Pliny (xv 40)
mentions the custom 01 sending home
despatches 11103111οᾱ with lanrel on
the announcement osvin-tor). Cf.
Liv. v. ·23, “Litterae Postumio

101100 011 the face of it gives an
unmistakeable impression of 10-
forring to military promotion in its
common meaning, not the promo-
tion of soldiers to offices about the
gov'ernors establishment, such as
the 11031301Ί the‘ scribae,' ‘act-ensi:
‘lictor,es' &c., according to the
view of W ex. *Α30110’ seems used
absolutely in the sense of ‘to

(⁴ ascripticii ⁸) to the ranke, or men
f1om the allied cohorts to the
legionary troops.

fides.i1mmz putare] Another read-
intr here is ‘fidelissimum‘ The
difference between the two words ls
said to be as follows: ‘Fidus' is
a man whose attachment to one's
cause or person can be relied on;
‘fidelis' is a man trustworthy' m the
discharge of duties committed to
him. An army 13 called‘ fidus' to
its leudem aslaveuould be‘ fidelis'
to his master Ηο11ον01, this dis·
tinction 13 often neglected.

is common in 111101· writers. Cicero* s
