held so tightlv as to restrict entirely

Ru-oz'i el Lea-nuzii] Of these peo-
ple, the former were probany at first
settled on the Bultic coast. the is-
land of Rugeu being named from
them. After Attila‘s death they
showed themselves on the Danube,
in Austria and Upper Hungar).
The Lemovii were perhaps near the
river Leba. North-west of Dantzic,
in Ponierania.

Xle. ipso in Oceano] Tacitus
seems to have considered Sweden
and the Scandinavian l'euinsula as
an island. Pliny (iv. 27> certainly
did: “qui sinus Codanus vocatur,
refertus insulis quarum clarissima
scandinavia est, incompertae magni-
tudinis.'' Probably the natue of
Sweden (Sverige. the kingdom of
the Svia) is only a corruption of
the word Suiones. Tlien ‘ipso in
Oceano ⁹ of course means the Baltic.

in ordinem] That is, ⁸ ita ut ordo
fiat‚' to form a regular tier of oars
after the Roman fashion.

nullisjam emt-eptimdbus] This ex-

pression marks the contrast between
the Suiones and the Lygii and
Gothones in thelast chapter. There
the sovereign power was never so
excessive as to endantzer the freedom
of the members of the state; here
there are no limits to the authority
of the king

p] muno-jure parendi] ‘piccarium
jus is a privilege only granted toa
person s enti-eat), as a 'favour which
cannot be clainiv'd as a stiict right.
Tacitus often uses the word. Cf. H.
i. 52, and A. i. 42. One would
rather bave expected ‘imperitandi'
or a similar word here, than ‘pa-
rendiz' however, it comes to very
much the same thing,—‘ the claim of
the king on the subject for his
obedience.'

enimvero (Sc-,1 This explains why
the arms are kept under the custody
of a slave. The previous clause,

quia subitos) &c.‚ gives the reason
for their being kept locked up.

reaia utilitas ei] Tacitus seems
to have had no conception of a kin
other than of the despotia orientxiff
