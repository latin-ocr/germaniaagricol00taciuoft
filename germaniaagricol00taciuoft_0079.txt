CVzasuar-iz] There is some doubt
as to the locality of this peoflde.
Wilhelm places them North of the
Chatti, and West of the Chamavi.
According to Ptolem, they are
North-west of the Chatti. and near
the head-waters of th(- Erns. Per-
haps as Chatti hec-anie Hessiuns, the
Haase river may retain traces of the
name of the Chasuarii. Afterwards
they appear amongst the Franks in
the duchy of Gueldres.

Frisii] The Frisii have retained,
asmuch as any German tribe, always
about the same sett¹en1ents. They
were divided into Minores and Ma-
'ores; the soimer- dwelt lVest of the
boesa Drusiana, in the provinces of
Gueldres :ind Utrecht: the Majores
between the Flevo and the Ems, in
the 'provinces of u'est Friesland
and Groningen. They were sted-
fast allics of the Romam, and aided
Drusus and Germanicus in their
war against the Cherusei. In ΑΙ). ’28
they revolted, when Olennius op-
pressed them, and after putting a
number of Romans to the sword
near the Silva Baduhenna, threw off
the Roman yoke (A. iv. 72). In
ΑΔ). 59 they took possession of
vacant lande near the Rhine 3 and on
being threatened by Dubius Avitus,
the governor of the province, with
vengeance unless they retired, they
sent their two kings, Verritus and
Malorex, to Rome3 these distin-

further mention of them until the

Their descendants are still settled in
the islands west of Sleswig.

the word metaphorically. ‘ prae-

fringe the shore? Here the Rhine is
described as set like a fringe at the
extremity of the Frisian territory.

immensos insuper luc-ias· eja] The
lakes here mentioned are the Flevo
and others which afterwards formed
the Zydersee. Suetonius (Clau-
dius l.) informs us that Drusus first
navigated the Northern Orean, and
his son Germanicus passed with four
legions on board his ships, from the
Rhine. by the Fossa Drusiana,
through these lakes into the ocean,
as far as the Ems (A. i. 60, and
ii. 8). According to Suetonius,
Drusus was warned by a vision to go
no further.

illa] Tacitus often uses this
ablative of the prononn, with ‘via'
understood. Cf* A. ii. 17, “incu-

‘in that quarte1·;' and H. v. 18,
