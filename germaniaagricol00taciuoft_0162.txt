146 AGRICOLAE VITA.

dinis: vacua castella, senum coloniae, inter male parentes
et injuste imperantes, aegra municipia et discordantia:
hic dux, hic exercitus: ibi tributa et metalla et ceterae
servientium poenae, quas in aeternum perferre aut statim
ulcisci in hoc eampo est. Proinde ituri in aciem et
majores vestros et posteros cogitate.” ’

moris, cantu fremituque et clamoribus dissonis. Jam-
que agmina et armorum fulgores, audentissimi cujus·
que procursu: simul instruebatur acies, cum Agricola,
quanquam laetum et vix munimentis coercitum militem
accendendum adhuc ratus, ita disseruit: “Octavus annus

country' will be the soldiers of for-
tune, those who have ‘another
country* will be all foreign corpe,
like the Usipii, Batavi, &c.‚ serving
in Britain.

senum coloniae, effic] There was

summer, and this was now the end
of the summer, he regards the
eighth year as already beginning;
the year being the seventh up to
the anniversary day of his arrival‚¹
and the eighth afterwards. If the

then, really, only one ‘ colonia ' Ca-
mulodunum, the ‘senum' being the
veteran soldiers settled there.

The Municipia (towns with their
own senate, and Duumviri, with
most of the rights of Roman citizens)
were ill at ease from want of union
between the inhabitants and their
rulers. Londinium and Verula-
mium were two of these Muni-
οι ia.

pXXXIII. accendendum adhuc] See
the note on ⁶ adhuc' in c. 19 of the
Germania.

Octavus annus est] Agricola was
Consul AD. 77, and entered Britain
the following year, ΑΛ). 78. He
crossed the Bodotria in the sixth
year of his command, and in the fol-
lowing year, as it seems, fought the
battle at the Grampian Hills. Agri-
cola then ought to have said ‘se-
venth' instead of ‘ eighth) To make
the computation right, some reckon
the time from Agricola‘s consulship,
'which seems rather a lame explana-
tion. Ritter's view is, that as Agri-
cola arrived in the middle of the

Roman soldiers understood this with-
out any explanation, they must have
been extremely shrewd. I think it
possible—I can hardly say I think it
probable—that Agricola reckons from
a date before he joined the army in
Britain. Part of the troops, at all
events, may have been in the field
for seven years past, and done some-
thing towards conquering the island,'
although Agricola himself had not
been at their head more than six.
No doubt, Agricola afterwards en-
tirely identifies himself with the
army, but I do not sce that this
proves necessarily that the army
could not have been spoken of as
conquering Britain before Agricola
joined them ; he does not say ‘ vici—
mus,' but ‘vicistis' lt is perhaps
hard to say which is the least un-
satisfactory explanation.

auspiciis nuper-ii Romani] One Ι

would have expected ‘impera-
toris' rather. Perhaps Domi-
tian being now dead, Tacitus pre-
ferred avoiding any mention of so
unworthy an occupant of the throne.
