AGRICOLAE VITA.

ac flagrantem animum coercuisset. Scilicet sublime et
erectum ingenium, pulchritudinem ac speciem magnae
excelsaeque gloriae vehementius quam caute appetebat.
Mox mitigavit ratio et aetas: retinuitque, quod est diffi-
cillimum, ex sapientia modum.

the infinitive of what in the Oratio
directa would have been ‘haurie-
bat,' or ‘ hausit;' for the perfect is
used in this way as well as the im-
perfect. A similar sentence occurs
in c. 13, ‘⁴ Agitasse C. Caesarem de
intranda Britannia satis constat, ni
ingentes adversus Germaniam co-
natus frustra fuissent.''

pulchritudinem (ιε speciem] ‘Pul-
chritudo ' is defined by Cicero to be
“quaedam apta figura membrorum
cum coloris quadam suavitate.'' It
expresses therefore the beauty of
appropriate and symmetrical arrange-
ment, ‘comeliness.' ‘Species' is
the beauty that strikes the eye, and
challenges observation.

vehementius quam caute] The
common construction of course
would require ‘ cautius' here. ¹ Wal-
ther professes to see a difference of
meaning between the two forms.
Ι can see none.

ex· sapientia] This means, Ι think,
that after the mellowing influence
of reason and time had wrought a
change, Agricola retained—a hard
thing to do—as a 'relic of his old
philosophica] pursuits, the power of
self-conquest and moderation.

V. adprobavit] ‘Adprobare' is
to make any thing satisfactory to
another, Cf. A. xv, 59, ⁶ Dum ipse
majoribus . . . mortem adprobaret?
Cicero‘s usage seems in favour of
‘probare' in this sense. Cf. Ad
Attic. iv. 14, and de Finibus, ii.
25.

’ quem contubernio aestimaret] ‘ Con-
tubernium' (from ‘ taberna,' and ‘ta-
bula,¹ because made of plank) is used

N ec Agricola licenter

fora number ofsoldiers living together
in the same tent, or for the tent itself.
It was customary for young Romans
of distinction to accompany some
general during foreign expeditione,
to learn experienee in military ope-
rations. They niessed with tho
general, and lived under his eye,
being called ‘contubernales' They
were distinguished from his ‘co-
mites,' as holding no office or func-
tions under him. Cf. Cic. pro
Caelio 30, and Suet. Jul. 2, and 4‘2.
‘ Aestimat-e* here means ‘to ascer-
tain the value of,' ⁶ to test ;' and the
general's aim was to find out by
constant association in war of what
metal the young soldier was made.
The word is used iu the same senso
in H. iv. 73, “bonaque ac mala
non sua natura sed vocibus sedi-
tiosorum aestimantur.” As Valerius
Paulinus is said (H. iii. 43) to have
been sprung from Forum J ulii, pos-
sibly Suetonius Paulinus may have
also; and this would account for
his taking Agricola into his tent.
Paulinus was Propraetor in Maure-
tania, ΑΛ). 42ς governor of Britain,
A.D. 59; and consul in ΑΛ). 66
(Α. xvi. 14). He was one of Otho's
gene1·als; and with Marius Celsus
defeated Caecina near Cremona.
After the battle of Bedriacum he
fell into the hands of Vitellius.

IVec Ayrz‘eola §vj I think
Cicero's phrases, 'ad honestatem
omnia 1·eferre,' and ‘ omnia ad suam
utilitatem refe1·re,' furnish a clue
to the meaning of the sentence.
‘Titulus tribunatus' expresses a
kind of brevet tribuneship3 and 83
