AGRICOLAE VITA.

defuncti hominis, venia opus fuit: quam non petissem,
incursaturus tam saeva et infesta virtutibus tempora.

IL Legimus, cum Aruleno Rustico Paetus Thrasea,
Herennio Senecioni Priscus Helvidius laudati essent,

ni proximi prensam dextram vi
attinuissent:'' and there are many
other passages ot the same sort. Cf.
A. 1. 6:2; xi 34. H. i. 64 The
generil sense uili be as follows:
As things are in oui day, 1 must
have solicited the permis. ioii of Do-
mitian; this 1 should not have been
inclined to do, as Ι was about to
treat of times so cruel nnd hostile to
all displays of excellent-ies, as the
mere toneliing on such topics as I
must have embraced in Agricola's
life, would have aroused ihe anger of
Domitian.' At the saule time, this
use of the indicative soi· the cou-
junctioe, unless followed by 'ni' or
⁵ nisi,' is suspicuous3 and one might
he inclined 10 adopt another reading
tound, ⁶ ni cursaturus tam saeva‚' δια,
unless there were serious objections
to that reading too on other grounds
defuncti It inlinis] 'lhe proper
meaning of defungi is to complete
ones duty thoroughly, as neque
ego lubeniei pro m utiniis tuis bene-
ficiis tam vili munere defungor
orationis,” Cic. ad Fam. x. 24. It
is used with ‘ vita? in the sense of
completing one's life. Cf. Virg.
Georg. iv. 475, “defunctaque cor-
pora vita Magnanimum heroum.”
It is also used with ‘morta' with
the same meaning ultimately, al-
though it is arrived at in a different
way; as in Suetonius (Jul. Caesar,
ad fin. ) “ neque quisquam sua morte
defunctus est, '¹ ⁴ got over the act of
dying.⁸ The absolute use of de-
functus' for dead, seems chiefl), if
not entirely. a later usage, found in
Tacitus, Suetonius, and their con-
temporaries and successors.

Paetus Thrasea] Thrasea was a
Stoic, a great admirer of Cato Uti-
censis. He is first mentioned, A.D.
57. as supporting the Cilicians in
their charge against Cossutianus
Capito, tlieirlate⁰g‹uei·‚iior He first
provoked the anger «f the court by
speaking against a Senatus con-

tianus and Eprius Marcellus, and
condemned to death, A.D. 66.

Herennio Senecioni Priscus Hel-
vidius] The former of these wasa
native of Baetica, in Spain, and
subsequently Quaestor there. He
was accused, under Domitian, of
taking no part in public affairs (cf.
H. i. 2 ‘omissi honores ') and of

in the steps ofliis father-in-law; and
when Thrasea was put to death he
was banished. He remained at
Ap ollonia 111 Macedonia until the
death of Nero. He was recalled by
Galba, and brought Eprius Mar-
