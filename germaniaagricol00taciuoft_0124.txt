AGRIOOLAE VITA.

Jam vero tempora curarum remissionumque divisa: ubi ’
conventus ae judicia poscerent, gravis, intentus, severus,
et saepius misericors: ubi officio satisfactum, nulla ultra
potestatis persona ι tristitiam et adrogantiam et avaritiam
exuerat: nee illi, quod est rarissimum, aut facilitas

auctoritatem, aut severitas amorem deminuit.

Integ-

ritatem atque abstinentiam in tanto viro referre, injuria

virtutum fuerit.

facile justeque agebat]
presided with ease to himself, be-
cause he was up to his work (cf.
Suet. Tib. 71, ‘alioquin promptus
et facilis sermone Graeco‚' &c.).

et saepius misericors] Some of the
commentators want to alter this ⁸ et'
into ‘ sed ' or ‘ at 3' but Tacitus often
uses ‘ et ' in this sense. Cf. A. i. 13,
'Gallum avidum et minorem,' and
H. iii. 56, “ nec quidquam nisi ju-
cundum et laesurum.⁵ So Juvenal,
‘ probitas laudatur et alget ς’ honesty
is praised and—starvcs.

persona] ‘ Persona' is properly a
mask for stage-players‚ to increase
the compass of their voices; by an
easy transition it means a character
like those in adrama. Cf. Cic. pro
Murena, 3, “ partes lenitatis et
misericordiae semper egi lubenter:
illam vero gravitatis severitatisque
personam non appetivi.''
iii. 36, “ille tinis Appio alienae
personae ferendae fuit: suo jam
vivere ingenio coepit.''

tristitiam . . cauerat] that
Tacitus means by ⁴ tristitia' he ex-
plains in H. i. 14, “aestimatione
severus, deterius interpretantibus
tristior habebatur.”

The use of ‘exuo' here is not

A gricola

quite easy to understand. lf a man
puts off a vice, one naturally supposes
him to have had that vice at first
rmore or less. Tacitus would hardly
allow that Agricola ever displayed
the fanlts mentioned here. His idea

Also Liv. . .

Ne famam quidem, cui saepe etiam

really seems to have been that certain
vices may be looked for in persons
holding certain positions: avarice,
&a he regards as the natural faults
of a provincial governor3 probably
they were such in nine cases out of
ten in his experience. By ‘ exuerat’
he means to say that Agricola put
away from him the vices which
might naturally have been expected
to cling round him in his capacity of
governor. so Agrippina is said (A.
vi. 25) “virilibus curis feminarum
vitia exuisse‚'' meaning apparently
not that Agrippina once had these
faults and cured them, but that she
put away from her all the faults
usually found in women.

facilitas] The word has not the
same sense as ⁴ facile ' above. Here
it means ‘good-nature‚' ‘readiness
to oblige‚' as in Virgil's ‘facilis victu,'
and ⁸ haud facilis visu.' In this re·
spect Agricola carried out the in-
structions of the higest: “obser-
vandum est jus reddenti, ut in
adeundo quidem facilem se praebeat
. mandatis adjicitur ne praesides
provinciarum in ulteriorem famili-
aritatem provinciales admittant.”

Inteyritatem atque abstinentiam]
The first shows his uprightness ow
the bench, whereby he was proof
against corruption3 the latter his
honesty in not making a fortune out
of the state moneys or property which

he had to control.

cui saepe etiam boni] For the
sentiment cf. H. iv. 6, “Erant
quibus adpetentior famae videretur

quando etiam sapientibus cupido
gloriae novissima exuitu1.''
