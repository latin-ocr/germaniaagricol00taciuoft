42 DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE.

XVII. Tegumen omnibus sagum, fibula, aut, si
desit, spina consertum. Cetera intecti, totos dies juxta
:focum atque ignem agunt. Locupletissimi veste distin-
guuntur, non fluitante, sicut Sarmatae ac Parthi3 sed
stricta et singulos artus exprimente. Gerunt et ferarum
pelles, proximi ripae negligenter, ulteriores exquisitius,
ut quibus nullus per commercia cultus. Eligunt feras,
et detracta velamina spargunt maculis pellibusque bel-
luarum, quas exterior Oceanus atque ignotum mare
gignit. Nec alius feminis quam viris habitus, nisi quod
feminae saepius lineis amictibus velantur, 'eosque purpura
variant, partemque vestitus superioris in manicas non

extendunt, nudae brachia ac lacertos3 sed et proxima.

pars pectoris patet.

found by rigorous search. for which
the enemy lacks time and inclina-
tion.

XVII. spina consertum] For some
reason or other Lipsius objects to
this, and proposes to read ‘pinna'
instead of ‘spina,' understanding by
it, I suppose, a. ⁵ fishbone,' or ‘skewer
of wood·,' but one would think a.
thorn as likely a priori to be used
for fasteninff a. dress as a fishbone.
Virgil, at all events, uses a thorn for
the same purpose, Aen. iii. 594
‘consertum tegumen spinis;'' and
Ovid, Met. xiv. 166, ‘et spinis con-
serto tegmine nullis?

veste] Tacitus seems to mean by
this ‘an inner garment,' distin-
guished from the outer cloak, which
formed the sole dress of the great
mass of the people, here designgated
hythe word‘ sagum' us sed just be-
fore. The‘ vestis was the J·d1ess of
the richer sort, who do not seem to
have wom the ‘savum' at all,

judging from c. 6, where the words⁴

‘nudi aut sagulo leves are used ap—
parently to designate the two classes

prom'mi ripae] Those of the Ger-
mans who dwell near the Rhine, and
from their proximity to Gallia and
the Roman traders are able to pro-
cure a more civilized (hess, take less

pride in their skin coverings, and are
more careless in the arrangement
of them, not thinking them good
enough to take much trouble about.
The tribes less acquainted with the
Roman and Gallie wares had nothing
better, and were anxious, therefore,
to make the most they could of their
native niaterials. This seems clear
enough, but some of the critics have
been anxious to make the passage
implv just the opposite, byB trans-
posing the two adverbs. y the
‘ripa' here mentioned Tacilt3us in-
tends the bank of the Rhine.

macula pellibusque] This seems to
mean, that the) decorate the hides
of wild beasts nith spots or different
coloured patches made out of the
skins of sea monsters.1f εο, ‘·ma.
culis pellibusque belluarum' is put
for‘ maculis pellium belluinarum*
by Hendiadvs like virgilws pateris
libamus et auro.³

pmpura] 'lhis was not theg
nuine ‘purpura‚ obtained from tghe
murex, but a ὼε got from some
plant. Pliny (xvi. 18) mentions
the‘ vaccinium '·(pe1haps the whor-
tleberry) as used by the Gauls for
dxeing ‘'arments.

XVIII. Quanquam] This refers
to the words at the end of the last
