44 DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE.

sacra, hos conjugales deos arbitrantur. Ne se mulier
extra virtutum cogitationes, extraque bellorum casus
putet, ipsis incipientis matrimonii auspiciis admonetur,
venire se laborum periculorumque sociam, idem in pace,
idem in proelio passuram ausuramque: hoc juncti boves,
hoc paratus equus, hoc data arma denuntiant. Sic vi·
vendum, sic pereundum: accipere se, quae liberis invio-
lata ac digna reddat, quae nurus accipiant, rursusque ad
nepotes referant.

XIX. Ergo septa pudicitia agunt, nullis spectacu-
lorum inlecebris, nullis conviviorum imitationibus cor·

ruptae. Literarum secreta viri pariter ae feminae ignorant.
Paucissima in tam numerosa gente adulteria, quorum

has in view here the marriage by
‘confarreatio,' in which ‘panis far-
reus ' was used, and certain religious
ceremonies observed. As this was
the most solemn method of con-
tracting marriages in use amongst
the Romans, Tacitus pethaps refers
to it.

XIX. septa pudicitia] There is
a different reading in the MSS.
here, some having ⁴ septae pudicitia,⁹
with a slightly varied meaning 'lhe
reading' lu the text means, that the
German women lived with their
chastity hedged round from all that
could assail it externally. ‘Septae
pudicitia' implies that they‘were
protected from harm by their own
purity; like Godiva, ‘clothed on
with chastity. ’

nullis spectaculorum inlecebris]
The corrupting effect on the mora-
lity of the Roman ladies produced
by the games and theatres‚ is often
mentioned hythe Roman writers,
Juvenal, for instance, xi. 162Ί &c.
Seneca, too, describes himself as
returning home from the show, a
worse man than lie went (“ Nihil
est tam damnosum bonis moribus
quam in aliquo spectaculo desidere3
avarior redeo, ambitiosior, luxurio-
sior'' .

Litgrarum secreta] No doubt
some of the Germans could write.
Maroboduus, for instance, is meu-

tioned (A. ii. 63) as having sent
a letter to Tiberius: but such cases
were probably the exceptions. Tlios e
tribes w ho uexe in contact with Gaul,
may have known something of the
Keltic alphabet. and used t>it; but
the mass of the people across the
Rhine were most likely entirely
unacquainted with written charac-
ters, unless an improbable anti-
quity be given to ‘mnes' 1 believe
these words of Tacitus to mean,
‘of the secret communication
possible where written characters
are known, they have no idea;'
implying, of course, that lovers did
not correspond by means of notes:
butl do not think it is absolutely
stated in this sentence. ln other
words, ‘literarum' l believe to
mean ‘ written characters,' not ⁶ (love)
letters? lf the Germans had known
characters, it would not have taken
them long, one may be sure, to
turn them to this particular use.
For the extent of the practice al-
luded to at Rome, compare Juv.
vi. 231, and xiv. 29. There was
one species of tablets especially
used gor this purpose3 cf. Martial
(xiv. ),-

“ Nondum legerit hos licet puella,
Novit quid cupiant Vitelliani.''
