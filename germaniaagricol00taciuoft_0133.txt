(iv. 5. 2) mentions gold, silver, and
iron as products of Britain. Caesar
speaks of tin (‘ plumbus albus') as
obtained from the interior, and iron
from the Maritime parts, rather
reversing the fact. Cicero indeed
(ad Attio. iv. 16) remarks, “illud
jam cognitum est neque argenti
scripulum esse ullum in illa insula;”
Eut here he was saying more than he

new.

Copper was also found. Of this
last. round pigs have been discovered
iu wales: one being preserved at
Mostyn Hall 'm Flintshire, bearing
an inscription, ‘ Socio Romae.' Iron
works existed in the country of the
Silures, near the forest of Dean. and
in the weald of Sussex and Kent
vast masses of ‘scoriae' or slag
have been found at Maresfield and
elsewhere. Tin was found, as at
present, in Cornwall and wale-s,
where Roman mines,1 believe, have
been traced, and blocks of Roman
tin found. Traces of lead mines
are numerous in Shropshire and
other places, and pigs os lead, with
the minei-'s stamps on them, are
found. Some of these pigs have
‘ex argent) on them, or ‘lut(um)
ex argent0,' in allusion to some pro-
cess for separating the lead and silver
often found together then, as now,
in our silver-lead mines. A silvei·
ingot, with a Roman inscription,
was found in the last century near
the Tower of London in digging for
foundations. Gold has been traced,
in quartz formation, in Wales, near
Lampeter, and great mounds of
pounded quartz still remain.

maryarita] Pliny (ix. 57) ob-

serves that pearls were found in
Englaud (small, however, and dis—
coloured)·, for Julius Cacsar de-
dicated a breast-plate to Venus
entirely composed os British pearls.
Suetonius makes Caesar‘s eagerness
for pearls his motive for invading
this country (Jul. Caesar, 47).

There used to be a regular pearl
fishery near I'erth up to the close
of the last century, when it became
exhausted. I believe they are often
found also in the river Conway.
The Romans were excessively fond
of these articles of luxui-v. Plinv,
in an amusing passage ‘(ix. 56),
says, “Hos digitis suspendere, et
binos ac ternos auribus, feminarum
gloria est3 quin et pedibus nec
crepidarum tantum obstragnlis sed
totis socculis addunt; neque enim
gestare jam margaritas nisi calcent,
ac per uniones etiam ambulent, satis
est.'' The Romans were even foolish
enough to dissolve and drink them
(Plin. ix. 58, 59). Cf. Martial, viii.

artem abesse] According to Pliny
(ii. 55), the divers had to practise
considerable skill; for the oyster
snapped at the divcr's ssngers, and
lopped them off if he were not
quick enough in his motions. The
rocks too, where pearls were chiefly
found, were dangrrons.

in rubro muri] By this Tacitus
means the Persian gulf, a portion
of the θάλασσα ἐρυθρά. Pliny
says, “ Praecipue laudantur eirca
Arabiam in Persico sinu Maris
Rubri.'' Tacitus uses Mare Rubrum
for the Persian gulf. A. ii. 61,
“Exin ventum Elephantinem ac
Syenen, claustra olim Romani im-
