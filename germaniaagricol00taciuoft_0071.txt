DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE. 57

Gallos in Germaniam transgressos. Quantulum enim
amnis obstabat, quominus, ut quaeque gens evanuerat,
occuparet permuturetque sedes promiscuas adhuc et nulla
regnorum potentia divisas? Igitur inter Hercyniam sil-

nomen, significatque loci veterem memoriam, quamvis
mutatis cultoribus. Sed utrum Aravisci in Pannoniam

Germaniam commigraverint, quum eodem adhuc sermone
institutis moribus utantur, incertum est: quia pari olim

cupancy.

Aravisci . . . . ab Osis] The first-
mentioned people were situated in
the north-east corner of Pannonia,
near Buda and Komorn. The Osi
were east of moravia. In c. 43,

Helvetii] Tacitus here makes
this people once settled between the
Rhine, the Main, and the Hercynian
forest, i. e. in the northern portion
ofthe duchy of Baden, and part of
Bavaria. lf they ever were there,
the Germans must have driven them
back3 sor in Caesars time they were
west of the Rhine, between it and

Builtemz' nomen] This name means
the ‘home of the Boii 3³ ⁴ hem “ being
the ‘heim' in Mannheim, and the
‘ham ’ of English names. As
Bavaria means very much the same
thing (cf. Cantware, the people of
Kent), it is not certain that Bohemia
is here designated to the exclusion
of Bavaria ; at all events, the locality
here given suits the position of mo-
dern Bavaria as well as that of
Bohemia. See Dr. Latham's note
on the passage.

quamvis mutatis]
Livy (v. 34), one of the two sons of
the king of the Bituriges, Segovesus,
crossed the Rhine with a large body
of his countrymen, and penetrated
to the skirts of the Hercynian forest.
The Boii seem to have followed him,
and settled in the country Bohemia
or Bavaria (see the lust note). This
is said to have taken place when
Tarquinius Priscus was king at
Rome, B.C. 600. From this abode
they were afterwards driven by the

According to

Tacitus mentions that the Osi were
proved by their Pannonian language
not to be Germans; therefore the
description here given of their being
a nation of Germans only implies
that their position was in a country
mainly occupied by Germana. In
other words, the statement here is
a geographical‚ not an ethnological
one. Probably, 1 think, they were
Slavonians3 and the only question
is, whether the Osi had pushed for-
ward to the locality here given
them, or were a remnant left, when
the gieat bulk of their countrymen
were driven out by Germanic in-
vaders. As the country occupied by
them seems to have been moun-
tainous, they probably were able to
maintain themselves in their strong-
holds when the other Slavonian
population was broken up, and
forced to retire.

Treveri] As Tacitus below speaks
of certain tribes as unequivocally
German (6 haud dubie Germano-
rum populi‘), it seems a fair in-
