gather shells as trophies of their

was reduced to hire red wigs for liis

ing the dison-«iered state of the
Roman empire consequent on the
violent death of Nero, Galba, and
Oth0, and the struggle between
Vitellius and Vespasian, the Batavi
and Canninefates, at the instigation
of Civflis, threw off the Roman
yoke. To this revolt Tacitus alludes
here. cf. H. iv. 15.

triumph for his sut-cesses against the
Chatti (Suet. Domit. 6).
XXXVIII. suen-i] These are
not to be confounded with the Suevi
of Caesar (iv. 1-17). As before
remarked, his Suevi are the Chatti
of Tacitus. The Suevi here men-
tioned were rather an aggregate of
peoples, than a single tribe. and

German. And this raises a question
of great interest. Tacitus beyond
doubt considers all the district
occupied by the Suevic tribes to be
Germanic. In our day equally
beyond doubt a large part of this
area, pomerania, Bohemia. Hun-
gary, Polzind, διο, are, and have
been, Siai-onie for centuries. Either
then Tacitus was mistaken, or enor-
mous changes must have occurred
since his day, and what was Ger-
manic then, is Slavouic now. Against
this latter hypothesis there is this
to be said, that in this portion of
Europe the oldest traces of names
are Slavonic3 that the time hardly
allows of such an entire vhange, Bo-
hemia, for instance, being Slavonio
as early as the seventh century ς that
in historic periods Slavonians have
reti-eated before Germane, and not
vice versa3 that when Charle-
magne reduced those countries. there
appear no traces of previous German
orcupancy. I believe, then. Tacitus
to have been niisinformed; foi· his
means of information about these
distant tribes must have been very
uncertain. For full notices of the
question here alluded to Dr. Latham
should be consulted, froin whom I
have taken the main substance of
the note.

‘obliquare' is found only in the
poets of the Augustan age, and tho
prose writers of the silvei· period.
