DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE.

affectione animi, sed quia numerus argenteorum faei-
lior usui est promiscua ac vilia mercantibus.

VI. Ne ferrum quidem superest, sicut ex genere

telorum colligitur.

Rari gladiis aut majoribus lanceis

utuntur: hastas, vel ipsorum vocabulo frameas gerunt,

‘ serrati? If the reverse bore a four-
hou-sed eharim, they were called
‘ quadrigati?

mamm-us aryenteorzwz] The stand-
ard gold coin was the ‘aureus num—
mus) or ‘ denarius? and there were
gold coins of one, two. three⁷ and
four ‘scrupu]a,' the weight of the
‘scrupulum ’ being· eighteen grains.

The silver coins were the ‘ quin-
arius‚' equal to half a ‘denarius‚'
the ‘ seste1·tius‚' equal to one qnarter3
the ‘ libella‚' or ‘ ηεξ representing one
tenth ς the ⁴ sembella ' half the last,
and the ‘teruncius' half the last
again3 equal in value to about half
a fai-thina. Varro mentions the
‘teruncius' as a silver coin, although
Cicero speaks of the ⁸ libella' as the
least.

VI. Ne ferrum quidem superest]
There is a similar use of the word
below in c. 26, “arva per annos
mutant et superest ager :'' ⁵ there is
land enough and to sparez' here it
means ‘even of iron there is no
superabundance.' This of course
only proves the Germans not to have
had any great amount of skill in ex-
tracting the ore, for there are large
iron mines in certain parts of the
country, Bohemia for instance. In
the graves of the earliest period
known in (lei-many the weapons
found are of bone οι· stone, and it is
only after a considerable period ap-
parently that iron or bronze arms
are found. By some the former are
supposed to belong to a pre—Teutonic
racc, but the question is an open
one at present.

Rari] This word is used of any
thing. the parts of which are separated
by large interstices or intervals, and
1s opposed to ‘densus:' ⁶ retia rara'
are uets with large meshes. T hen the

word is used for any thing found only
here. and there; skirmishers for
instance (Caesar, v. 16, “ nunquam
conserti, sed rari magnisque inter·
vallis praeliarentu1·”). and so it means
⁴ infrequent,' and lastly—a. meaning
chiefly poetical—‘ seui-ees ⁴ peerless.'
frameas] There is Some little
difficulty about the weapons here
mentioned, because Tacitus elsewhere
speaks of the Germans carrying im-
inensely long spears (A. ii. 21, and
H. V. 18). However. it is tolerably
clear that the ‘ lancea' was a heavier
weapon than the ‘hasta;' with a
broad leaf-like head and a longer
thieker shaft. By ‘ enormeS,⁴¹ or
‘ praelongae hastae‚' I suppose Tacitus
meant spears, or ‘frameaess where
the metal was large and fastened to
a long shaft. This word ‘ framea ' is
no doubt a latinized form of the
Teutonic ‘ pfriem? An awl, or bod-
kin, is still in German called
‘ pt'rieme.' The ‘framea' seems to
have been aweapon for stabbing‚ not
tlnowing. or cutting. The words
‘cominus' and ‘eminus‚' used just
afterwards to explain its uses, do not
therefore mean that it was at once a
missile (sor he says below, ‘pedites
et missilia spargunt ³). and aweapon
for close fight; but from H. v. 18,
“immensis corporibus et praelongis
hastis fluitantem labantemque mili-
tem eminus fodiebant.'' the latter
word (lc-notes a flght where the ranks
were not close, but the combatants
had room to bound here and there,
in order to dash down upon their
enemies. Annexed are the figures
of what are supposed to be the heads
of these ⁸ frameae,s and a lance
copied from Estorff's Heidnischer
Alterthiimer. And to give a better
idea the dimensions are annexed.
