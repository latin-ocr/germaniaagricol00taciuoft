126 AGRICOLAE VITA.
Nec Vettius Bolanus, manentibus adhuc civilibus bellis,
agitavit Britanniam disciplina. Eadem inertia erga
hostes, similis petulantia castrorum: nisi quod innocens
Bolanus et nullis delictis invisus, caritatem paraverat
loco auctoritatis.

XVII. Sed ubi cum cetero orbe Vespasianus et Bri-.
tanniam recuperavit; magni duces, egregii exercitus,
minuta hostium spes: et terrorem statim intulit Peti-
lius Cerialis, Brigantum civitatem, quae numerosissima
provinciae totius perhibetur, adgressus: multa proelia, et
aliquando non incruenta3 magnamque Brigantum par-
tem aut victoria amplexus est aut bello. Et cum Cerialis
quidem alterius successoris curam famamque obruisset,
sustinuit quoque molem Julius Frontinus, vir magnus
quantum licebat, validamque et pugnacem Silurum gen-

Vettz'us Bolanus] Statius regarded
this general through a very dis<
torted medinm. Writing to the
son, he says (silv. v. 2. 142) :

diu et quasi vagum imperium sus-
cepit firmavitqne tandem Flavia
ens.''

g Brzjqantum] The Brigantes oc-
cupied the Northern parts of the
island, from the Mersey and Humber
to the Scottish border.

alterius successoris] I think this
means, that although Cerialis would.
have endangered the reputation of
any other successor, less distin-
guished than Frontinus, this last
general did not lose by comparison
with him, and bore, as well as the
other, the laborious office of ruling
Britain. Similarly Tacitus says,
H. ii. 90, “ Tanquam apud alterius
civitatis senatum populumque mag—
nificam orationem prompsit.''

Julius Frontinus] He was Praetor
Urbanus in Α». 70, and perhaps
Consul Suffectus in A.D. 74. Under
Nerva he was made Curator Aqua-
rum, and an augur. After his death

XVII. recuperavit] As ‘recu-
perare ¹ is used here, and not ‘re-
cipere‚' Vespasian is spoken of
as having recovered the Roman
empire, previously lost, or held by

those who had no right to it. He
rescued it from the degradation it
suffered in the hands of such men
as Otho and Vitellius, and restored
it to its former dignity. Cf. H. ii.
76, ‘⁶ A contumelia. quam a laude
propius fuerit post Vitellium eligi.''
Als0‚ Suet. Vesp. l, “Rebellione
trium principum et caede incertum

his place in the Collegium was given
to Pliny the Younger.

quantum licebat] This probably
means that Vespasian threw some
obstacles in the way of any further
development of his great qualities
in more extended conquests‚ either
from motives of eeonomy, or for
other reasons.
