VI. Hinc ad capessendos magistratus in urbem
digressus, Domitiam Decidianam splendidis natalibus
ortam sibi junxit: idque matrimonium ad majora nitenti
decus ac robur fuit: vixeruntque mira eoncordia, per
mutuam caritatem et invicem se anteponendo, nisi quod
in bona uxore tanto major laus, quanto in mala plus ·
culpae est. Sors quaesturae provinciam Asiam, procon-
sulem Salvium Titianum dedit3 quorum neutro corruptus

iii. 83, ‘ spolia in vulgus cedebant.'
In A. xiii. 39 a dative is used
instead of the preposition and ac-
cusativc.

addidere] There is no zeugma
here, for ‘addere' is not particu-
larly applicable to ‘stimulos' and
‘addere spem,' ‘mettum' ‘alacrita-
tem,' ⁴ vigorem,q ‘constantiam,' are
found in Tacitus.

Vl. decus (tc rohai-fuit] Probably
the splendid desccnt of his wife and
her large dowry were of material
help to Agricola, as adding lustre to
liis pretensions, and giving· him
means for defraying the expenses
incidental to a. dignified discharge of
office.

nisi quod eje] As Seneca re-
marks, ⁵* Quamvis ad eundem finem
uterque pervenerit, tamen major
est laus idem fecisse in difficiliori
niate1·ia.¹' As for a wife therefore
to be a had wife is thought more
faulty than for a man to be a bad
husband, because it seems to be
her especial province to discharge a
wife's duties well, so owing to the
natural weakncss of her sex, to rise
high in excellence deserves more
praise in a woman than in a man.
The words ‘nisi quod' rather refer
to a thought suf-'gested by the pre-
vmus words (cf. A. i. 33; xiv. 14),
viz. that they equally attained to

excellence, and therefore equally
deserved praise, than to the exact
words themselves. At the same
time, for the sake of the antithesis,
Tacitus, Ι think, has sacrificed
clearness of meaning to a fancied
omt.
p Sors quaesturae provinciam Asiam]
Every proconsul was attended ‘to his
province by a Quaestor, who was
paymaster to the forces, and levied
such portions of the revenue as were
not farmed by the Publicani. After
their election at Rome, they were
appointed to the particular provinces
b r lot.

§The province os Asia was only a
small part os Asia Minor, contain-
ing Phrygia, Mysia, Caria, and
Lydia. lt originated in the bequest
of Attalus to the Romans, B.C.

›S'alvz'mn Titianum] Salvius Otho

Titianus was the elder brother of
the emperor Otho, with whom he
was consul in ΑΛ). 69. In the war
against Vitellius, he was left in
charge of Rome, bnt was called
thence to take the chief command.
He was contemptuously pardoned
by Vitellius, ‘pietate et ignavia
excusatus.'

parata peccantibus] This means
that in Asia there were people
always ready to help a corruptly
