XLI. Crebro per eos dies apud Domitianum absens
accusatus, absens absolutus est: causa periculi non cri-
men ullum aut querela laesi cujusquam3 sed infensus
virtutibus princeps, et gloria viri, ac pessimum inimico-·
rum genus, laudantes. Et ea insecuta sunt reipublicae
tempora, quae sileri Agricolam non sinerent: tot exer-
citus in Moesia Daciaque, et Germania et Pannonia,
temeritate aut per ignaviam ducum amissa3 tot mili-
tares viri cum tot cohortibus expugnati et eapti: nec·-
jam de limite imperii et ripa, sed de hibernis legionum et

possessione dubitatum. Ita cum damna damnis continu-

efforts to obtain cclebrity by outward
show and splendour.

quaererent sinnam] ‘'Quaerere is
used for‘ desiderare, ‘to have to
seek fora thing* ‘to miss it.' Cf. Cic.
in Verr. v. 18, “ Aetnensis ager sic
erat deformis atque horridus ut in
uberrima parte Siciliae Siciliam
quaereremus ” Most people saw in
the plain man before them no traces
ofhis great celebrity3 few only were
able to take its true mensule. In
the caieful avoidance of all noto-
riety they saw the extent of his fame.
Under a jealous EmpelQor the more

disguise it by studied quietness and
retiiQement

XI Ι. absens] The charges against
him were so transpalently false,
that he was acquit‘oed even in his
absence

laudantes] These ciafty maligners,
knouing the emperor s jealous y en-
deavoured to inspire him with
hatied of Agricola by constantly

Mn tm ia] This country was bounded
ou the South by Mons Haemus;
West by the river Drinnus(D1in),
a tributary of the Save: North by
the Danube, and East by the Euxine
Sea. It uas divided into Louer or

Eastem, and Upper or Westem
Moesia, comprismg Bulgaria and
Servia, respectively East and West of
the river Cebrus, a small tributary
of the Danube. The disasters here
spoken of occurred ΑΛ). 86-91.
Oppius Sabinus was defeated in
Moesia by the Dacians, under De-
cebalns, aud himself slain. Sub-
sequently Cornelius Fuscus, sent to
levenge this defeat, was surprised
by the Dacians, his army de-

Germania] This refers to the
wars against the Marcomani and

Pannonia.

empnynatz'] ‘ Expugnare' properly
applies to the storming of towns,
cz imps, ἃς. lt is also used for taking
men prisoners, by forcing their
strongholds. Cf. Liv. xxiii. 30, ⁴⁴ Nec
ulla magis vis obsessos quam fames
expugnavit.” In the same chapter
of Livy there is, “coriis herbisque
vixere nec antequam vires deerant
expugnati sunt.''

de limite imperii] See Germania,
c. 29. There are said to be still
xisible remains of a line of Roman
forts from Peterwardin to Becs, on
the Theiss. The ⁴ ripa* here men-
tioned is the right bank of the
Danube as far as the Quadi.
