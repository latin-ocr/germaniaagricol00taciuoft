DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE.

XXVI. Foenus agitare et in usuras extendere, igno-
tum: ideoque magis servatur quam si vetitum esset.
Agri pro numero cultorum ab universis in vices occu-
pantur, quos mox inter se secundum dignationem parti-
untur: facilitatem partiendi camporum spatia praestant.

the emperors at Rome freedmen
were all-powerful. ‘⁴ Plerique prin-
cipes‚” says Pliny, Paneg. lxxxviii.
s. l, “eum essent civium domini,
libertorum erant servi3 horum con-
siliis, horum nutu regebantur, per
hos audiebant, per hos loquebantur.''
WVhen Pallas⁷ a freedman of Clau-
dius (‘ quasi arbitrum regni agebat‚'
is the account Tacitus gives of him),
was removed from his offices by
Nero, he was described as having
abdit-lated the imperial throne. (A.
xiii. 4.)

XXVI. Faenus agitare] There is
some difficulty about this passage.
‘ Foenus ¹ is used by Tacitus several
times; and in some passages means
interest, and in others capital. (See
A. xiv. 55, and vi. 17.) lfit means
interest here, it is not easy to say
what the words ⁴ in usuras extendere'
are.. unless it implies to get compound
interest, which does not seem to me
a likely thing for Tacitus to say;
nor do I see that the words naturally
suggest this idea. Ι believe rather
that ‘foenus agitare' is a general
phrase, for to embark in money
transactions, to employ capital ς and
the next words add the idea of
putting out this capital to interest,
a. notion not of necessity implied by
the first words2 for Suetonius speaks
of ‘gratuito aut levi foenore.' As
has been noticed in the Introduc-
tion, this passage is a. good measure
of the historian's wish to contrast
the German and Roman habits3 for
otherwise, after his remarks on the
absence of money⁷ the observatione
here made would be extremely
superfluous.

Ayrz' ‹Sc.] This is a very difficult
passage to understand, although a.
very easy one to translate. As far

as Ι can make it out it means as
follows :—⁴‘ A tribe, or canton, or
subdivision ofit,having plenty ofland
about them, took possession as a
community (⁸ ab universis') of a
quantity of it, suited to their num-
bers <Α pro numero cultorum'). As
soon as this was done (⁵ mox ⁹), they
divided this land into portione, some
larger, some smaller, for the ‘ prin-
ῧίξὲἒᾷῃᾱῖῗιῗ ᾱῖἒὲίῗῗοᾷρέῗῗρθοῖἷὲῗέἶ
harvest they allowed the fields,
just reaped, to lie sallom and se-
lected other land in like manner.
The year following they might, of
course. isthey liked, select again any
portion, great or small, they found
convenient ot' the fallow land, and
so on yearly (‘in vices'). This
they were able to do, as there was
land enough, and to spare (‘ superest
agcr')‚ and there was no necessity
for any system of rotation crops.”
A point 1 am not clear about is,
what the praedial slaves did; for
each was said to have his own home-
stead3 and in A. xiii. 54. fixed
abodes are mentioned. Possibly
however as the huts were only
turfed over, or hollowed out under
hill-sides, &c ‚ there is no such ab-
solute permanence implied as to
interfere with the supposed annual
change. If this is a correct view of
the passage, it‘will agree very well
with Caesar's account of the matter
(vi. 22), according to which the
magistrates yearly assigned to divi-
sions of the tribe different porticus
of land.

Some of the editors, however,
not satisfied with this account, in-
stead os‘in vices‚' read ‘in vicos,'
and refer the passage to the per-
manent occupancy of the soil:
