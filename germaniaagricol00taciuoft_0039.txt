DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE. 25

quidem suus honor, aut gloria frontis: numero gaudent:
eaeque solae et gratissimae opes sunt. Argentum et aurum
propitii an irati dii negaverint dubito. Nec tamen ad-
firmaverim nullam Germaniae venam argentum aurumve
gignere: quis enim scrutatus est? possessione et usu
haud perinde adficiuntur. Est videre apud illos argentea
vasa, legatis ‚et principibus eorum muneri data, non in
alia vilitate quam quae humo finguntur: quanquam
proximi ob usum commerciorum aurum et argentum
in pretio habent, formasque quasdam nostrae pecuniae
agnoscunt atque eligunt: interiores simplicius el: anti-
quius permutatione mercium utuntur. Pecuniam pro-

latitudes. Some corroboration of
this is given by the fact that when-
ever the bones of oxen, sheep, &e.‚
have been discovered in England, as
they often have in large quantitieS,
they appear to Jiave belonged to
species much less than ours at pre-
sent.

suus honor. aut! ylario] Tacitus
includes apparently both horses and
oxen in their herds2 the* suus honor*
will then mean that the hor-es do
not attain their full growth and
beauty. and the cattle have only
stunted horus.

amentum aurumve yisynere] Taci-
tus (A. xi. 20) mentions a. sil‘ver
mine opened and worked for a short
time, but soon exhausted, in the
lands of the Mattiaci. Of thisbe
probably had not heard when he
wrote the present work. Caesar (vi.
28) alludes to the German custom of
ornamenting horus with silver. and
using them for drinking-caps. How-
ever, in the tombs that have been
opened, silvei· articles are not often
found, those of gold being more
frequent. At present, 1 believe,
silver as well as gold is found in
considerable quantities in Bohemia;
although not in such large aniounts
as 300 or 400 years ago, when as
much as nine million ounces were

raised in less than a century. Gold
is also found in Hungary, silesia,
and Salzburg.
haud perinde] That is, as much
as other peoplc are. So Agric. lo,
“ mare ne ventis quidem perinde

non in alia vilitate] i. e.‚ held in

ρνωῐπιὶ] Those who were brought
most into contact with the Romans,
from dwclling on the banks of the
Rhine or Danube. Another reading
is ⁴ proximi oceano ς’ this can hardly
be right. Even with the Belgae,
Caesar sayS, the Roman tradcrs held
little intercourse, and they would
hold still less with the Germane

washed their Northern coast.
serratos lzigsczlosque] These coins
are the ‘denarii' Compare Liv.
xxiii. 15, “laetoque juveni promissis
equum eximium dono dat, bigatosque
quingentos quaestorem numerare

jubet;'' and the same author (xxxiii.

'l'hese coins were silver‚ and on the
obverse usually have the head of
Rome with a helmet. or the Dioscuri
