Varus] Quinctilius Varus was
made governor of Germany about
Ab. 7 or 8. As Drusus had con-
quered a great part of the country
as far as the Wescr, Augustus de-
termined to reduce the country to
the form of a. province Varus was
unfortunate 111 his way of carrying

tacked his army, and completely
annihilated it, near the defiles of
the Salius Teut1 berulensis, between
Osnabruck 111111 Paderhorn. This
defeat lost the Romans: ’111 between

never succeeded in firmly re· -esta·

Drusus <10 Nero ct Germanicus]
The Nero 11616 mentioned is Tibe-
iius Claudius Nero, the emperor,
brother of the Drusus whose name
precedes. After the death of Drusus,
he commanded in Germany, and
crossed the Rhine; and again, aster
the loss of Varus, obtaining a
triumph at Rome for his successes.
In accord. inre with the. account given
of the conjunctions at the beginning
