DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE. 47
centur: ac robora parentum liberi referunt. Sororum
filiis idem apud avunculum, qui apud patrem honor.
Quidam sanctiorem arctioremque hunc nexum sanguinis
arbitrantur, et in accipiendis obsidibus magis exigunt3

tanquam ii et animum firmius et domun1⁰latius otene-

ant.
et nullum testamentum.

Heredes tamen successoresque sui cuique liberi:

Si liberi non sunt, proximus
gradus in possessione fratres, patrui, avunculi.

Quanto

plus propinquorum, quo major adfinium numerus, tanto
gratiosior senectus: nec ulla orbitatis preti a.

XXI. Suscipere tam inimicitias seu patris seu pro-

pinqui quam amicitias, necesse est:

apud avunculum] This is an uncle
by the mother's side, as distin-
guished from ‘patruus,' just as
‘matertera' and ‘amita' are aunts
in acorresponding manner. Amongst
the Romans the ‘patruus' was the
more important person of the two,
because he was ‘agnatus‚' as well
as ‘J'cognatus while the other was
only the latter3- and by a law of
they XII Tables, in default of a
will, the ‘tutela' was given to
a‘griati' only. The respect thus
paid to sisters' sons may have arisen
from the estimation in which women
were held amongst the Germane.

et deinum latius teneant] Because
to take a mans sons as hostages,
would bind only their f-ttlier3
whereas to take 1115 nephews, would
give a hold not only on the man
himself, but the parents of the
hostages as well.

prom'mus yradus] In this matter
the German custom ‹iiffered from
the Roman law. There, according
to Ulpian (Frag. tit. 26. 51), a
man's heirs were first his own chil-
dren, grandchildren, δια, or, falling
them, his brothers and sisters by
‘the same father (⁶eonsanguinei');
next, the nearest of the remaining
‘agnatiss Consequently the avun-
culus' being‘ adfinis' only, and not
‘stagnatus could not inherit, except
of course by the express direction
of 3 testator.

juxta valent :³⁷

nec implacabiles

adfinium] The ‘adfines' were
properly the ‘cognati' of husband
and wife, and therefore the con-
nexion implied in the word was
only possible through marriage.

orbitatis pretia] At Rome the
advantages of childlessness were
great3 not indeed legally: for the

‘orbus' was subject by the ‘lex
,Iulia et Papia Poppaea' to certain
legal penalties. From the actual
state of society, however, he was
regarded as a fortunate man. Cf.
H. i. 73, “potens pecunia et orbi-
tate, quae bonis malisque temporibus
also Dialogue de
Orat. c. 6, “in ciV1tate nostra plus
gratiae orbitas confert quam eripit.'’
They were paid great court to by
their friends, in the hope of obtain-
ing a legacy, and were inundated
with presents, large fish, διο. (JUV. V.
98: iii. 221, &c.)

XXI Su cipere tam inimicitias]
Such was also the custom of the
Scottish clans, where feuds raged
for centuries, because the son ifelt
bound to take up his fathers quar-
rels. Thus the Mackintosh and
Macdonald clans were at feud in
consequence of some dispute origi-
nating so far back as the days when
Danish pirates nasted the coasts
of Scotland. Similarly the Kerrs
and the Scotts were hereditary
foes.
