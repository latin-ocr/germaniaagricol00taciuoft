maritum, quo modo unum corpus unamque vitam, ne
ulla cogitatio ultra, ne longior cupiditas, ne tanquam
maritum, sed tanquam matrimonium, ament. Numerum
liberorum finire aut quenquam ex agnatis necare, flagi-
tium habetur: plusque ibi boni mores valent, quam alibi
bonae leges.

XX. In omni domo nudi ac sordidi, in hos artus, in¹
haec corpora, quae miramur, excrescunt. Sua quemque
mater uberibus alit, nec ancillis ac nutricibus delegantur.
Dominum ac servum nullis educationis deliciis dignoscas.
Inter eadem pecora, in eadem humo degunt, donec aetas
separet ingenuos, virtus agnoscat. Sera juvenum Venus3
eoque inexhausta pubertas: nec virgines festinantur:
eadem juventa, similis proceritas: pares validaeque mis-

liberorum finire] What Tacitus the ground, whether it should be

means by this is seen from Juv. vi.
594, &c. This offence does not
seem to have been originally taken
notice of by the Roman law. Sub-
sequently, however, it was punish-
able (Cic. pro Cluent. e. ll), and
under the emperors visited with

exile, or condemnation to the
mines.
coe aynatz's necare] The word

‘ agnati* is not used here in its legal
meaning of all the relations through
male descent, who would be in the
‘ patria potestas,' but in the sense of
‘ those who are born aster? Pliny
has the same use, xi. 94, “ congeniti
maturius defluunt; agnati celerius
crescunt.'' The Roman father was
allowed full discretiori as to bring-
ing up the children born to him.
The infant was placed on the ground
at its birth, and the father showed
his intention of rearing it or not by
removing it from the ground, οι·
Ιεεινίιισ it there. Cf. Terence, Heaut.
iv. l. s3. Amongst the scandinaviam
nations this custom also existed. In
Icelaud, so late as the tenth century,
all children born deformed, or crip-
pled, seem to have been consigned
to destruction by exposure, the
father, as amongst the Romans, de-
ciding by taking up the child from

reared or not.

XX. nec ancillis] Tacitus, of course,
is here reproving the customs of his
own day at Rome. The author of
the Dialogue de Oratoribus drawn
a contrast between the old Romans
and their descendants in this re-
spect: “Jam primum suus cuique
filius . . . . non in cella emptae
nutricis, sed gremio ac sinu matris
educabatur. At nunc natus infans
delegatur Graeculae alicui ancillae,
cui adjungitur unus aut alter ex
omnibus servis, plerumque vilissi-
mus nec cuiquam serio ministerio
adcommodatus ” (e. 28, 29).

virtus aynoseat] ‘until virtue
recognizes them for her own.' For
the subjunctive mood after ‘donec,'
sce the note on c. ].

pares] This does not mean that
only matches were allowed between
those who were equal in station,
but that the married pair were
equally strong and robust.

validaeque] There is a reading
‘validi' in some of the editions.
In this case the masculine includes
the bride and bridegroom, just as
‘ fratres ⁷ may be used for a brother
and sister, and ‘reges' for a. king
and queen.
