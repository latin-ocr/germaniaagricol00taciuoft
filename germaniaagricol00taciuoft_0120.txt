AGRICOLAE VITA.

abundantiae duxit, uti longe a luxuria, ita famae propior.
Tum electus a Galba ad dona templorum recognoscenda,
diligentissima conquisitione fecit, ne cujus alterius sa·
erilegium respublica quam Neronis, sensisset.

VII. Sequens annus gravi vulnere animum domum-
que ejus adflixit: nam classis Othoniana licenter vaga
dum Intemelios (Liguriae pars est) hostiliter populatur,
matrem Agricolae iu praediis suis interfecit: praediaque
ipsa et magnam patrimonii partem diripuit, quae eausa

caedis fuerat.

Igitur ad sollemnia pietatis profectus

Agricola, nuntio affectati a Vespasiano imperii depre-
hensus, ac statim in partes transgressus est. Initia prin-

very clear. ‘Ludos ducere' can
hardly mean ‘ to give shows, ⁸ ‘edere
being the proper w01d for 111111·
the phrase lather seems to be equi-
valent to ‘ludos .habend0s esse
duxit? ‘Ratio is put for< striet
rule,' the rule of not spending a
farthing more than what good reason
cau be given for spending. lVex
quotes a passage from Seneca (ad
Helvid. 16), ‘⁸ optimum inter pieta-
tem et rationem temperamentum,”
where ‘ratio' is afterwards called
‘inhumana duritas? and this is
piwett) much the idea her.e The
whole passage means then, ‘the
games and ουψῖ) pageants attached
to the Praetor's office he legarded
as lequiring a mean between stiict
economy and lavish disp1a3311erein
avoiding all profusiori and iet lean-
ing to the side of popularity‚' by
shows, that is, eiriug, if they erred
at all, in the direction of magnifi-
cence.

sensisset] The natural sequence
here would be ‘ferit ne sentiretss
or‘senserit,' according to the sense
to be conveyed3 the former ex-
pressing the object, 115 viewed by
Agricolas own thoughts, 1115 aim
being to prevent the sp oliation of
the ‘ftemple being feltp hex-ond a
certain limit. P=Sense1iff would
express the object according to the
'writer's present view of it, Rgricola
having aimed to prevent the state

from now actually experiencing
more than a certain amount of spo-

liation. Theref01e ‘sensisset' is
unusual. It seems to be the sub-

junctive turn by reason of the par-
ticle ‘ne,' of what in the Oratio
directa would expiess the fact that
after the completion of the iuquiry
it was found the state had not in.
point of fact suffered any loss beyond
Neros sacrilege. W ex quotes a
similar passage from Plinys Pane-

gyrio, 40 idem effecisti ne malos
principes habuissemusv, '’ a. subj unc-
tive rendeling of ‘habueramus'

This of couise assumes that‘ ne'

max possibly be equivalent to‘ ut
non' in expressing a result, about
which there may be a difference of
opinion.
