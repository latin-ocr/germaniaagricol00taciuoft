62 DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE.

submittere, nee nisi hoste caeso, exuere votivum obli-
gatumque virtuti oris habitum. Super sanguinem et
spolia revelant frontem, seque tum demum pretia nas-
cendi rettulisse, dignosque patria ae parentibus ferunt.
Ignavis et imbellibus manet squalor. Fortissimus quis-
que ferreum insuper annulum (ignominiosum id genti)
velut vinculum gestat, donec se caede hostis absolvat.
Plurimis Chattorum hic placet habitus. Jamque canent
insigues et hostibus simul suisque monstrati: omnium
penes hos initia pugnarum: haec prima semper acies,
visu nova. ham ne in pace quidem vultu mitiore
mansuescunt. Nulli domus aut ager aut aliqua eura.
prout ad quemque venere, aluntur: prodigi alieni, con-
temptores sui: donec exsanguis senectus tam durae vir-
tuti impares faciat.

XXXII. Proximi Chattis certum jam alveo Rhenum,

rettulisse] The first syllable of hos tibus,5 &c.; for ‘'et and‘ que
the perfect of ‘refero' is always lons* are not usually although sometimes,
probably because it is contracted used for both. ,and' Monstratus'

is often emp lox ed by later writers in
this sense although raiely found ιιι
Cicero. Cf. H. i. 88, “vetusto no-
mine et propinquitate Galbae mon-
stratus; '' and Ph ny, Paueg. 88,

ut olim frugalitate Pisones, pietate

from an old reduplicated perfect,
‘ retetuli. ⁹ The word ought there-
fore to have a double ‘ t ' in the first
syllable.

ferreum insuper annulum] With
the Romans the ring was an emblem

of social rank, not, as with the Ger-
mans, a badge of disgrace. Senators,
chief magistrates, and, at last, ,⁴ equi-
tes‚' all wore golden rings, others
iron ones, although certain roble
families retained rings ot the last
metal. ln the days of chivalry,
vows similar to these here described
were common. Vertot mentions a
Duke of Bourbon, who with his
companions vowed to wear a ring
round the left leg every Sunday for
two years, until nthey should ineet
with opponents to sight with

hic placet habitus] The fashion,
Tacitus means, os w·ea1in,q rings and
letting the hair grow. Even after
killing an enemy many of the Chatti
pelmanently adopt the custom, for
this seems to be the meaning of

XXXII. certzqmjam alveo] Pom-
ponius Mela. has a similar phrase:
“Mox diu solidus et certo alveo
lapsus haud procul a mari huc et
illuc dispergitur.'' The phrase
clearly means to describe the Rhine
as confined within its banks, and
not overflowing its liuiits into pools.
I think Tacitus speaks of the river
as emerging so as to say from the
shallows and numerous bruches,
