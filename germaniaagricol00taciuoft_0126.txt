A. i. 3, and H. i. 77.

X. multis scriptoribus] These are
Caesar, Pomponius Mela, Suetonius,
Pliny, Strabo.

in comparationem] Tacitus does
not aim at matching 1115 033n research
or talent against thos 56 01 011161 1111-
ters. Cf Velleius Patercnlus ii. 9,

“Usque in Giae‹ 01 nm ingeniorum
comparationem evecti.''

perdomita est] ‘ entirely 6011-
quered.' This was no doubt true.
As Tacitus mentions in c. 13, Ju-
lius Caesar's expeditions were merely
temporary in their effects. In the
last he penctrated no further than
Hertfordshire, and on his withdrawal
his whole force withdrew too. Au-
gustus threatened to reduce Britain,
but Gaul saw the end of his cx-
pedition, and Horace's remarks (i.
21. 35, &c.) are poetical flourislies.

Tiberius acted upon Augustus
policy ofletting Britain 310116, as not
worth the trouble of conquering and
ietaining. Caius Caesars conquest
of Britain amounted 10 ha3ing shel-

Cynobellin. Under Claudius the
work of conquest really betran That
emperors name 15 found on coins
and those of his generals in inscrip-

events retained the hold already

spatio] ‘Spatium' seems used
here for ⁸ extension, ‘length of out-
line,' as in Plin3 vii. 17ῗ( quod sit

&c. Tacitus means to say that the
British and German coastsy are about

shows that these parallel lines must
