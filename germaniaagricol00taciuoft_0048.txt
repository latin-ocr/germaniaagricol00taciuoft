but the knowledge of these symbols
vas probably contined to the p1iests,
-even if they existed at all so

favourable, two good, and one bad,
or two bad. and one good.
Saxo Grammaticus mentions a

early, which is extiemely doubtful,
—and this species of divin-niori
seems to have been perfotmed by
the head of the family as often as
not, who would know nothing
whatever of these Runes. The
words only mean that some mark
or other was put on the twigs by the
inquirer, to denote approval, or the
reverse.

temere clcfhrtnz'lo] One does not
see any great difference between
these words: but the former means
‘at rand01n,' ‘without any· care ς’
and the latter, that the twigs fall
‘just as it happens.' There might be
a given way to throw them, and
yet it might be done ‘ temere ;' but
ono way was as good as another,
and this made it done‘ fortuito?

ter sinyulos lollzt] This would
naturally I think, mean, ‘he takes
them up one by one thrice;' but
it seems here to mean rather, ‘he
takes np single twigs three times
in successim? lt is not easy
to see how there could be any
divination at all the other way,
unless indeed some account were
taken of the order in which the
marks, favonrable or unfavonrable,
=Wcre taken np. As Orellins ob—
serves, there were four possible
combinations, all favourable, all un-

species of divination in use amongst
the Rugiani: “Tribus ligni par-
ticulis, 'parte altera albis, altera
nigris in gremium sortium loco
conjectis, candidis prospera, furvis
adversa signabant?

auspicioeunz fides] This means
the assurance given by the auspices.
In c. 39, however ‘fides antiqui-
tatis' has a very different meaning,
viz. ‘the belief 1n its antiquity.'

equorum quoque praesayia] A
notable instance os this is mentioned
by Herodotus (iii. 84), where the
neighing of a horse was to deride
which of the conspirators against
Smerdis was to occupy the throne.
In the same author (i. 189) there
are sacred horses mentioned in an
account of Cyrus's expedition. lf
the Teutonic nations really came
from Media, the cnstom might have
been a reinnant of their old usages.
One way divination uas practismi
by means of hot-,ses is mentioned
by Saxo Grammaticus (bk. xiv.).
Spears were put down in a centain
01der, and if the horse stepped over
them with the right leg first, it
was lucky3 if with the left, the
reverse.

here mentioned was the head most
