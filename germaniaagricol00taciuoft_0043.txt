Senium reliquisse] To leave the
shield behind in battle was regarded
by Teutonic nations, long after the
age of Tacitus, as a singular dis-
grace. By the Salic law, any free-
man, who act-used another of having
thrown his shield away, was con·
demned to pay a hcavy tine, if unable
to prove his words. In this respect
these nations resembled the Greeks
and Romans. The fact that ῥίψ-
ασπις was a term ofbitter re roach,
and the Spartan mother‘s aconic
address to her son on issuing to
battle, ⁸ this, or u on this,' are indi-
catione οἱ this feeling.

multique superstites] A feeling
similar to this was displayed, ac-
cording to Herodotus'story (vii. 229),
by a Spartan who from accid‹·ntal
absence escaped the carnage of the
three hundred at Thermopylae. Un-
able to bear the disgrace of surviving,
he hanged himself.

VII. ea· nobilitate] ⁵ Nobilitas· is
used by several writers for the body
of nobles; but here, apparently. it
has its usual meaning of high birth;
and the monarchy is described as
at once elective and hereditary.
The regard paid to family in this
matter is seen from the account
recorded by Tacitus of the wish of
the Cherusci to procnre a scion of
their royal house from Rome (A.
xi. 16). Probably the real fact was,

that the king was chosen from one
family, or occasionally from more
than one. ln a rude and turbulcnt
age. when a good deal depcnded on
the personal character of the rulcr,
weak princes and minors wcrc not
likely to meet with much consi-
dvration ; and consequently, al-
though the succession was thus
limited to one family, the electors
would not pay much regard to the
‹·laims of any particular member of
it, thinking more of thews and
sinews than of sti-iet hereditary
right. At all events, in our saxon
history, instances of the sort were
not uncommon. Alfi-ed, for instance,
ascended the throne to the exclusion
of the children of his elder brother.
ln the early periods the king was
only the chief magistrate in peace.
If he were a warlike one, the nation
no doubt accepted hini as their
leader in war3 if not. they chose
others.

sumunt] From Tacitus* account (H.
iv. 15) the usual ceremony obscrved
on clection was, to place thc man on
a shield, and carry him about on the
shoulders of his countrymen. Gre-
gory of Tours mentions the same
cnstom as prevailing amongst the
Franks.

infinita potestas] Caesar (v. 27)
makes Ambiorix, king of thc Ebu-
rones, remark that the power of the
people over him was quite as great
as his over the pcople; and this was
doubtless at least as appii->able to the
Germans bevond the Rhinc, who
were not likely, with their fondness
sor liberty, to submit to much re-
sti-aiut.
