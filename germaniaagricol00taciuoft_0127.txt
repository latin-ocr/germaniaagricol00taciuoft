and the French coast then takes a
sharp tum southward. They thought
the Northern and lVestern shores
stretched away in a South·westem
direction, in continuation of the
German coast, while the Spanish
coast rose to a great height towards
the North or North—west. In the
angle thus formed they placed
Britain and Ireland.

Gallis in meridiem ξω] 'This ex·
pressiori is equivalent to ‘ita Gallis
in meridiem obtenditur ut ab iis
inspici possit.'

Livius veterum, effa] In the Epi-
tome ofthe 105th book ofhis History
Livy gives a brief notice of the
partial conquest of the island by
Caesar. It is in this lost book no
doubt that he makes the comparison
here mentioned. Tacitus quotes
Fabius Rusticus several times (A.
xiii. 203 xiv. 23 xv. 61) as an au-
thority for certain facts connected
with the Emperor Nero's histmy.
His work therefore at all events
treated of this portion of Roman
History3 beyond this, nothing is
known.

oblongae scutulae] This word is
not derived from ‘scutum‚' for the
quantities of the first syllables are
different. Pliny (xi. 28) calls a
spider's web ‘ scutulatum rete.³ Vi-
truvius speaks of triangular and

square ‘ scutulae? Probably the
writers meant a ‘ trapezium) Mar-
tial uses ‘scutulae’ (xi. 31) in the
sense ‚of saucers or dishes.

in animm-um] That is, report
applies to the entire island what is
only true of a part.

enorme spatium lja] This means
that where the shore appears to be
already coming to an end, the land
suddenly juts out into a hu e and
irregular promontory, gradua ly ta-
pering away to a point, or the small
end of a wedge. By ‘extremo jam
littore' he designates the narrow
isthmus between the Clota and
Bodotria aestuaria, or the Friths of
Clyde and Forth.

incoynz'las] Pomponius Mela, who
lived in the reign of Claudius, men-
tions the Orkneys as about thirty
in number3 therefore ‘incognitas '
means ‘unknown‚’ as not having been
explored„ not in the sense of ‘un-
heard of! Other writers, Eusebius
and Orosius, attribute the conquest
of them to Claudius3 probably this
was a flourish in honour of the Im-
perial name.

dispecta est] ‘ Dispicere' is properly
‘ to look here and there‚’ ⁴ to gaze all
round.' Cf. Plaut. cist. iv. 2. 25,
‘' Hoc age ς ad terram aspice, dispice,
oculis investigans,'' of a person look-
ing about for a lost casket. Also A.
