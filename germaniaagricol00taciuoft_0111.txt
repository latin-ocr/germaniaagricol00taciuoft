AGRICOLAE VITA. 97

capitale fuisse: neque in ipsos modo auctores, sed in
libros quoque eorum saevitum, delegato triumviris minis-
terio, ut monumenta clarissimorum ingeniorum in comitio
ac foro urerentur. Scilicet illo igne vocem populi Romani,
ei: libertatem senatus, et conscientiam generis humani
aboleri arbitrabantur, expulsis insuper sapientiae profes-
soribus atque omni bona arte in exsilium acta, ne quid
usquam honestum occurreret. Dedimus profecto grande
patientiae documentum: et sicut vetus aetas vidit, quid
ultimum in libertate esset, ita nos quid in servitute,
adempto per inquisitiones etiam loquendi audiendique

bumed there for the sake of dis-
gracing it still more deeply. the

or 94. Agricola died Ab. 93, and
Tacitus remarks in c. 45, that he

was lost to himself and his wife four
years before. Tacitus must there-
fore have been absent from Rome
for some years about this time. and
uses the word ‘legimus' probably
because he was only aware of these
events from the notices he may have
read of them in the newspapers, or
‘ acta diurna)

triumviris] The Triumviri Capi-
tales were regular magistrates, first
appointed about nc. 292, whose
functions in many respects were the
same as the old ‘quaestores parri·
cidii‚' or public accusers, and the οἱ
ἕνδεκα at Athens. They iuquired
into all capital crimes, enforced state
fines, supervised prisons, aud carried
out the sentence of the law on
criminals.
- in oomitioacforo] The Comitium
was a partos the Roman Forum,
forming its eastern and narrowest
end, and elevated above it by steps
(⁶ gradus comitii ’) t the Rostra being
in the centre of the line dividing the
two parts. The Comitium was ori-
ginally the scene of the patrician
electione and amemblieu the Forum
being appropriated to the · plebs.' At
the Eastern point of it was the tri-
bunal, where justice used to be ad-
ministered. It seems to have been
the spot where criminals were pun-
iahed (cf. Suet. Dom. 8. Liv. xxii.
57); and therefore the book was

buruing iu the Forum being only to
give the proceeding publicity.

expulsis . . . professoribus] This
event appears to bave occurred about

Junius Rusticus, &a

etiam . . audiendi] There is another
reading here, ‘etx' in which cwe it
is equis-alent to ‘etiam.' It is so
used, A. i. 4; vi. ‘222 xv. 73. ‘Et
. . . que' is apparently not used by
Tacitus iu a distributive sense. He
has ‘que .. . et' frequently. Cf.
H. iii. 63, “seque et liberos suos
Vespasiano permisisset.” A. i. 61,
“ut occulta saltuum scrutaretur,
pontesque et aggeres . . . imponeret.''
This is said by Orelli, I believe, to
be the usage of Livy and Tacitus
rather than of Cicero. ‘ Et. . . que'
is found in Cicero, Τιιεο. iii. 3, “ At
et morbi perniciosiores plures ue
sunt. animi uam corporis.” Aso
cf. Liv. iv, , “id et singulis uni-
versisque semper honori fuisse?
Other writers have it, but it is not,
I think, to be imitated. ‘ Et. . .et,'
‘ que . . . ac,' or ⁶ atque: are all com-
mon forms; ‘ que . . . que' is rarer,
but is found A. ii. 3, ⁸ seque regnum-

ue.' Cf. Sall. Jug. 21, ‘ita seque
ilisque dignum fore3¹ and Cat. 93
‘seque rempublicamque curabant?
The commonest use of it is in enu-
merations with the pronouu ‘qui ε’
sor instance, ⁴⁵ Captivi, quique Cam-
