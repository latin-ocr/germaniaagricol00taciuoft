Tiberius acioss the iiv3e1 near the
Semnones, b3 the 113 e1 Havel. They
revolted from ἈΙιιι-οὶοάιιυε, .1.n. 17,
to Arminius, and afterwards sup-
orted Italicus, the Cheruscan king.
n the third and fourth centumes
they mort-d southwards to the
Danube, exterminated the Heruli,
and in the sixth century settled in'
Pannonia. ln Ap. 568, under
Alboin, they cross sed the Julian
Alps, on the invit-ition of Nars s,es
and conqueied the plains of the
North wlni« -h have ever since borne
their name. Their last t kim Desi-

Reudi ιΨιί] The Reudigni were
probably situated between the duchy
of Lauenburg, and the mouth of the

Havel.

Aviones] The Aviones were
probably in Mecklenburg and Lau-
enburg.

Anglii] Ptolem3· places this people
north of the Langobardi, and east
of the Angriv·1rii ext‹·11d1ng as far
as the Elbe in the duchy of ‘Ma-2 de-

Saxons in the invasion of En gland

a district between Sleswio and
Flensburg, called Angelu3 but whe-

with the people in question is
doubtful

writers of the twelfth century, their
locality would be the parts about

tributary of the Elbe. They seem
to have also been found subsequently
in ΤΙιιιιὶῐιςζίειἶ whe1e the river W erra,

and the W eiing.tu may retain traces
of their name.

'l'he Eudoses were perhaps* 1n the
eastern partos the du1hy of Meck-
lenburg2 b3 others the3 are placed
in Helstein, where Eutin is thought
to be a remnant of their name.
The Suardones were perhaps on the
river Schwartau, near old Lubeck,
by Travemunde.

The Nuithones were somewhere
in the south-east of Meelzlenburg3
others place them on the river
Nuthe, in Middle Mark.

Hei-tham] The readings here vary
between Hertham, or Ertl am and
Nerthum Grimm 1n his‘ Deutsche

a goddess at all. But the Gothic

Saxon ‘ ertha,' all seem to point out
the other as the true rvading.

thought to be Rugen‚ in the Bauio,

But at the beg.¹ inning of the historical
period these rites, the ‹·,reed and

were no doubt Ἰθυῑοηίε, whatever
