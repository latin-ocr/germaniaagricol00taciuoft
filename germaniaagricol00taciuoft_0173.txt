AGRICOLAE VITA. 157

arentur, atque omnis annus funeribus et cladibus insig-
mretur, poscebatur ore vulgi dux Agricola: comparan-
tibus cunctis vigorem, constantiam, et expertum bellis
animum, cum inertia et formidine eorum. Quibus ser-“Mffl'g'glj'ss'⁴
monibus satis constat Domitiani quoque aures verberatas,m‹ml
dum optimus quisque libertorum amore et fisslss, pessimifflffi'a
malignitate et -livore, pronum deterioribus principemawy‘
exstimulabant. Sic Agricola simul suis virtutibus, simul
vitiis aliorum, in ipsam gloriam praeceps agebatur.

XLII. Aderat jam annus, quo proconsulatum Asiae
et Africae sortiretur, et occiso Civica nuper, nec Agriayawtc

dum optimus quisque ᾄσῃ] It is
curious that ‘damst in the sense of
‘whilst,' is perpetually joined to a
present tense, even when a proper
sequence requires a past tense. Cf.
H. iii. 86, “Amicitias dum mag-
nitudine munerum non constantia
morum contineri putat, meruit magis
quam habuit.'' It takes the indi-
cative present even in the Oratio
obliqua. ef. H. V. 17, “Suam
illic victoriam Germanis obstitisse
dum omissis telis praeda manus
impediunt.'' The former of these
uses is not so common in Ci—
cero, but in Livy, Caesar, Tacitus,
&c.‚ is constantly occurring. Con-
sequently some of the critics want
to replace the imperfect here by the
present.

viliis aliorum . . . praeceps aycha-
lur] Ritter translates the first
words ‘ by the faults of other gene-
tals: contrasting with his own suc-
cesses. l believe they mean the
faults of others (their malignity,
envy, δια), who plotted his destruc-
tion. The last words imply that
Agricola was hurried forward beyond
the power of retreat, to the very
embrace of glory,—-a turn perhaps
suggested by the common expres-
sion, ‘ praeceps in perniciem agi)

XLII. Aderat dja] These pro-
vinces οἱ Africa and Asia. being the

most important, and of chiefest
dignity, were given as a rule to two
of the oldest consulars. In A. iii.
71, Tacitus mentions, that when
Servius Maluginensis was unable to
accept the province of Asia, ‘⁶ sors
Asiae in eum qui consularium Ma-
luginensi proximus erat, collata.''
Agricola. as one of the two oldest,
was to decide by lot which of the
two provinces he should take How
many years after his consulship this
was is not known. At all events,
probably not more than four or five
§ears had clapsed ,since his return
from Britain, as the circumstances
seem to have occurred before Ta-
citus' departure from Rome, which
took place A.n. 90. The particulars
are minutely given, as though the
writer had been on the spot when
they occurred. that transpired after
that date is very bricfly described
by Tacitus, as not falling under his
immediate notice.

occiso Civica nuper]
(Domit. 10) mentions this incident.
Civica Cerialis was put to death by
Domitian whilst holding the pro-
consulate of Asia. This supplied
Agricola with a warning to avoid a
similar ‹li211ity himself. and would
have afforded Domitian a prece-
dent, if he had accepted it, sor
despatching him.
