'78 DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE.

Germanos· , et quod tributa patiuntur: partem tribu-
torum Sarmatae, partem Quadi ut alienigenis imponunt:
Gotbini, quo magis pudeat, et ferrum effodiunt: omnesque
hi populi p·1uca⁰campestrium‚ ceterum saltus et vertices
montium jugumque insederunt. Dirimit enim scinditque
Sueviam continuum montium jugum, ultra quod plurimae
gentes agunt: ex quibus latissime patet Lygiorum nomen
in plures civitates diffusum. Valentissiinas nominasse
sufficiet Harios, Helveconas‚ Manimos, Helysios, N ahar-
valos. Apud Naharvalos antiquae religionis lucus osten-
ditur. Praesidet sacerdos muliebri ornatu: sed deos
interpretatione Romana Castorem Pollucemque memorant.

Keltic postulati· ιιι dis placed by Ger-
mans. However this may be itis
I beliexe. a fact that the names in
the neiohbomhood of the Lunauald
are Keltic. The Pannonian tongue
spoken by the Osi must have been
one would think. Slavonic3 at all
events. these localities seem to have
been Slavonic as far back as they
can be trased. Dr. batham looks
on ⁴ Gallica ³ :is equivalent to Galli-
cian, the similarity of sound having
caused confusion. The ⁴ Gallica
lingua ³ would then be the Polish of
Gallicia‚ instead of Keltic ς however,
I do not see the necessity for at-
tributing a gratuitous mistake to
Tacitus.

quo magis pudeat] The Gothini
were not bound to be ashamed of
digging up ir‚on although this was
generally the work of slaves and
criminalzs but the dis-g r·a‹e lav in
this, that although they extructed

convert it into swords or spe-ais to
free themselves from their op-
pressors.

vertit-es montium] These moun-
tains would be the Erzgebhge,

Lzsyie] These people lived be-
tween the Oder and the Vistula,

extending from the sources of the
latter river to the point near Brim-
berg where it turns sharply to the
Nor-th -east in part of Gallicia and
W estern Poland. They first appear
as mambels of the Marcomanic
league ιιι their hostilities against the
Quadi taking part in driving out
their kingV annius(A. xii. 29). In
the third centuri they appear on the
Rhine. lt seems not unlikely that
the Lyg ii of Tacitus are the same as
the Lekhs, or Poles of later writers.
lf so, these people enumerated by
Tacitus were Slax onir, not Germanic.
See Dr. Latham' s note on the pas-
sage.

Harzos. eju] The Harii were

vecones, near W arsaw; tlic Manimi,
in Posen: the Hely sii, in silesia,
near Breslau, their5 name possibly
being preserved in Oels‚ a place in
this neighb‹›urhood; the Naharvali

nomen Alcis] Grimm makes Alcis
the genitive from Alx: it seems
much more likely to be the dative
δι attraction to ·,iis supplied from

‘ei numini' as usual in such sen-
tences. Cf. Liv. i. 34, “Puero ab
inopia Egeiio inditum nomen.'
The name here given proves nothing
as to the nationali-ty of the people,
a Germanic root, in Elk, strength,
