other cases the noun serves to point
out the sp here of the quality men-
tioned, ‘moderate in pleasure.
Here‘ mobilis' alone expresses all
that is required. ln leed the whole
sentence is awkwardly worded ς f1 r
the re etition of ⁸ fuis set' with the
first cause, taken from ‘sfru stra
fuissent’ in the second. is clumsy.
auctor operis] 'lhe work here
intended is that of the real sub-
'ugation of Britaing tor it was, as
before remarked, in this emperor‘s
reign that the foundation of the
solid conquest of the island was
laid. It was to a share of this work
that Vespasianus uas admitted by
Claudius ( ads sumpto in partem
rerum Vespasiano '.) Cf. H. iii. 44,
and Suet. Vsep 4.
eapti remes] An inscription (Orell.
Inscript. 715), ραι-11) restored, runs
thus: “Ti. Clav idio) . . . senatvs
Popv(lvsque Rom. qvod) reges
Brit(anniae) gentesque primvs in
dicio(nem P. R. redegit).''
monstratus satis] ‘pointed out
to us by the Fates,’ brought under
our notice as a future celebr-ity.
Looking ou the Fates as persons,
one would rather expect ‘a fatis)
in accordance with the usual rule.
However, Tacitus is not very par-
ticular about ohserving this. For
instance, “Facilius crediderim Ti-
berio et Augusto cohibitam'' (A.
oiii. 3),‘ ‘Urbes quae Macedonibus
sitae Graeca vocabula usurpant'*
(A. vi. 41) and“ L't exemplo ma-
jorum propinquis suis remor eretur
(A. ii. 50). sentences like the first

two, where a perfert participle occurs,
may also be regarded as cases of a
dative construction like that after
gerundives in ‘s·du just as in
Greek after perfect participles, the
dative' ls used instead of the regular
genitive and preposition For an
instance of this, cf. A. x. 29,
“Callistus jam mihi circa necem
Caii Caesaris nai-:nitus ⁹* Perhaps' in
all such instantes as thos se above,
and A. vi. 31. Liv. v, 15 (⁶ sed
propior interpres fatis oblatus'),
it is better to consider the cases
datives rather than ablatives
X1V.col‹ria] This was Camulo-
dunum the chief seat of the Bri tish
chief Cvnobellin, ori ginally called
Caer Colun. A strong body ot·
veter-ans was settled here to* coerce
the rebellious tribes. It is gene-
rally supposed to be Colehester.
Others think Maldon retains traces
of the old Roman name. The four-
teenth legion Gemina Martia Victrix
was stationed here, but recalled by
Vitellius.
quzdumno reyi] A stone found
at Chichester in the last century
had the following inscription (the
gaps being filled up by conjecture):
(N )ep tvno et Minervae tem plvm
(pr)o salvte do(mvs) divinae p(ex)
avctorita(te) (Tiberii) Clavdfii)
(Co)gidvbni r(egis) lega(ti) Avg(vsti)
in Brit.‚' ’δια lhis no doubt refers
to Cog'idubnuz, or Cogidumnus,
who apparently took the emperor's
name in addition to his own, and

embellished Chichcster.
