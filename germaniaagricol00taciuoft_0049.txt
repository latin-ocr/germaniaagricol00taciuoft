.DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE. 35

comitantur, hinnitusque ac fremitus observant. Nec ulli
auspicio major fides, non solum apud plebem, sed apud
proceres, apud sacerdotes. Se enim ministros deorum,
illos conscios putant. Est et alia observatio auspiciorum,
qua gravium bellorum eventus explorant. Ejus gentis,
cum qua bellum est, captivum quoquo modo interceptum,
cum electo popularium suorum, patriis quemque arinis
committunt: victoria hujus vel illius pro praejudicio
accipitur.

XI. De minoribus rebus principes consultant3 de
majoribus omnes: ita tamen, ut ea quoque, quorum penes
plebem arbitrium est, apud principes pertractent-ur. Co-
eunt, nisi quid fortuitum et subitum inciderit, certis
diebus, eum aut inchoatur luna aut impletur: nam
agendis rebus hoc auspicatissimum initium eredunt. Nee

if so. it was perhaps a rendering of ‘ servi' or ‘liberti,' had a voice in
the German ‘ ealdorman? the deliberations.

conscios] Tibullus (i. 9. 3), in pertractentur] One manuscript
the same way, speaks of the vic· has ‘praet1·actentur,' a word occur-
tim's entrails as ‘conscia fibra deo· ring no where else. From the words

rum.'

committunt] This word is used
for matching two combatants toge-
ther. So Juvenal (i. 162), “Securus
licet Aenean Rutulumque ferocem
committas.'' Something not unlike
this raetice existed amongst the
Scovch clans formerly. Before the
battle of Tippermuir, Montrose's
Highlanders are said to have mur-
dered a herdsman, in order to secure
the advantage of drawing the first
blood. Compare also a similar
incident in Scott's ‘Lady of the
Lake!

XI. principes] One edition has
a reading ‘princeps consultat ;“ but
the men intended here are, no
doubt, as noticed before, the pre-
sidents of the ‘pagi‚' whose duties
were chiefly judicial. All impor-
tant questions, of peace and war,
for instance, of capital punishment,
election of ‘principes,' &c.‚ came
before the ‘ concilium,' the ge—mot,
or sole-mot, where every member

’ of the tribe (plebs), other than the

‘ut ea quoque,' one would rather,
I think, expect a verb suited to all
matters of deliberation, whether
amongst the ⁶ principes* only, or the
general assembly, after their dis-
cussion. In this case ² pertractentur'
would be the true reading.

fortuitum et subitum] The first
word implies the occurrence of
any event unexpectedly happening3
‘subitum' that the event was an
urgent one, requiring instant dis-
cussmn.

Ιιυο auspicatissimum initium]
With this remark compare Caesar's
statement (i. 50) about the pre-
diction of the German women, that
their countrymen would have no
chance of success in battle, unless
they waited for the new moon.
The Greeks were equally super-
stitious in this respect. On the first
invasion of Greece by the Persians,
the Spartans, when urgent appeals
for help were sent by the Athe-
nians, could not march at once,
because it was only the ninth day
