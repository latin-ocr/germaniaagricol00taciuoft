114 AGRICOLAE VITA.

jussum, et hiems appetebat ε sed mare pigrum et grave re·
migantibus perhibent; ne ventis quidem perinde attolli:
credo quod rariores terrae montesque, causa ac materia
tempestatum, et profunda moles continui maris tardius
impellitur. Naturam Oceani atque aestus neque quaerere
hujus operis est, ac multi rettulere: unum addiderim,
nusquam latius dominari mare, multum fluminum huc
atque illuc ferre, nec litore tenus accrescere aut resorberi,

sed influere penitus atque ambire, et jugis etiam dc mon-

tibus inseri velut in suo.

illa in cognitione mentem P1·incipis.'’
From this it comes to be applied, as
Ernesti says, to “ea quae non sine
magna oculorum contentione cer-
nuntur.'' A glimpse was got of
Thule-3 and two reasons are given
why it was only a glimpse and no-
thing more, first, because Thule was
fixed as the limit of their voyage,
and on reaching it they returned at
once (⁴ hactenusjussum ') ς secondly‚
because the winter was drawing near,
and time for reconnoitring the place
more fully was wanting.

Thule] What Tacitus means by
Thule is not very clear. Pliny's
account of Thuse (iv. 30) is, that it
was the remotest island of the Ger-
man Sea, a day's sail from the Frozen
Ocean, where at the. Solstice there
was no darkness, and at the winter
no light. This would probably be
Icelaud. thether Tacitus, however,
means Iceland is very doubtful.
Possibly here it means the Shetland
Island‘s, which are visibIe, I believe,
from the Orkneys. Other writers
made Thule a part of Scandina-
via.

mare piyrum ege] Pliny (iv.
27) says, “ Septemtrionalis Oceanus,
Amalchium eum Hecataeus appellat,
a Paropamiso amne qua Scythiam
alluit, quod nomen ejus gentis lin-
gua significat congelatum. Philemon

ι Morimirusam a Cimbris vocari, hoc
est mortuum mare, usque ad promon-

torium Rubcas: ultra deinde Cro-

nium.'' In Wfflsh, Mor Marwffl, I
believe, means dead sea. In Ice-
landic again, Muir Croin is con-
gealed sea. Whether this is due to
sea-weed, like the fucus which is said
to have checked the progress of
Himilco, on the WVestern coast of
Africa, or whether to some other
legend, is not known.

ae multi rettulere] Amougst others
Pliny, in his Natural History, ii. 99
(where ‘aestus' is used as here of
the ebb and flow), and Strabo i. 3. 8,
treat of the tides.

multumstuminum] All round the
Scottish coast the sea penetrates far
inland, and forces its way, by fn'ths
and lochs, into the very heart of the
mountainous country. As these
friths and lochs have rivers disem-
boguing into them at their inner
ends, and by their waves at high
water force back the channels of
these rivers, Tacitus speaks of the
sea as driving (‘ ferre ³) the rivers on
all sides. By ‘ambire' he means
that the waves wind their way round
the hills, until the peaks become
insulated.

velut in suo] The sea is quite at
home in the heart of the country3 not
an intruder, but naturalized, as though
it were in its own proper domain,
the Ocean. The commentators quote
Seneca, Nat. Quaest. iii. 30, “Non
vides ut aestus fines suos transeat, et
in possessionem terrarum mare in-
dicat.”
