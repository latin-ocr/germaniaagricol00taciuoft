concerned, there is little doubt that
the Teutonic taces belonged to the
Indo-Germanic stock once occupying
Bactriana and part of Arme-mag a
fact rendered almost certain from
the general resemblance of tln-ir
language to those of Persia, lndia,
&c- According to one view the name
osone of the tribes of this Teutonic
people, the Saxons, is itself a con-
firmation of this; that appellation
being a corru tion from Saea sunu,

then a portion of that people who,
ages ago, issued from the regions of
Upper Asia, and making their way
by the Caucasus and the route north
of the Caspian and Euxine seaS.

they are more or less of the same
stock as the Greeks, Latius, Kelts.
and Slavonians. As for the time of
their entering Europe nothing what-
ever is known ; although some con-

quia nec terra olim] Tar-itus gives

three reasons for his belief in the
›indigenous origin of the Germans:
Q, that the chief movements of
natione were by sea, and the sea of
those countries was too boisterous to
venture on ς secondly. that the land
had no atu-actions to offer to so-
reigners to induce them to settle in
it; and, tlfinlly, because the tra-
ditions of the Get-mans themselves
represented them as the original
occupiers of the soil.

As far as the first of these reasons
is concerned, Tacitus was misle-d by
the want of any adequate knowledge
of the great movvments of the early
races who successively entered Eu-

rope. No doubt the emigrations
with which lie was histoncally ac-
quainted were efferte-d by δοίη the
colonization, for insance, of thc
African coast by the Phoenicians,
of certain parts of Grcecc by the
Essyptians, of Massilia by the Pho-
caeans, and others, was maritime.
The great movements, however, by
which Europe was peop'ed were in
some instances, at all events. long an-
terior to the rise of commeroe, and
the route was undoubtedly over
land, above the Euxine.

nee term . . . . et] These two par-
tieles are united in this way, because
the former is equivalent to “ et non3'
and then a second ‘et' follows na-
turally, in the next clause. Cf.
Cicero's Epist. ad Fam. x. l, ‘¹ Fur-
nium nostrum tanti a te lieri nec
miror et gaudeo,’' and A. xv. 28,
“ neque atrox in summani et quibus-
dam praeferturis inducias prtit.'' So
in Greek οὔτε is followed by τε.
Cf. Plato, Apol. 26, (ἶ, ἣ παν-
τάπασι με φῂς οὔτε αὑτὸν voul-
ζειν θεοὺς τούς ’τε ἀλλους ταῦτα
διδάσκειν.

ιιιΙι-εΙιεΙκιηίιιν] This word, of
course, only suits ‘classibus' and
another verb must be supplied to
suit ‘terrast Cf. A. iv. 49, “dein
fossam loricamque contexens,'' and
A. vi. 24, ‘⁵ ut quemadmodum
nurum filiumque fratris et nepotes
domumque omnem caedibus com-
plevisset.” .

adversae] I do not think this
means ‘ opposite to us,' at our anti-
podes, a sense the word has in Cic.
Somn. Scip. 63 but only ‘h‹›stile,'
‘difficult of navigati1m.‘ The ob-
jection made by walther, that,
if so, the apologetic expression, ‘ ut· ,
que sic dixerim' is unnccessary‚
does not seem worth much. Tacitus
may have thought the idea of the
