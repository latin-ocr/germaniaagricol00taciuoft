4 INTRODUCTION.

emergencies they withdraw quiclzly‚ and mount them. In their
view nothing can be more shameful or spiritless than to use
housings; consequently, they venture with the scantiest force
to attavi< any number, however large, of horsemen so equipped.
Of wine they entirely forbid the importation‚ considering it
to produce effeminacy and incapacity for enduring hardship.
1n a public point of view, they consider it the highest dis-
tinction to have vast tracts of waste lands beyond their frontiers.

cannot withstand their power. In one direction the lands are
said to be desolate to a distance of some 600 miles from the
Suevi. On the other side the Ubii adjoin them, a people once

Fire, and the Moon 3 the rest they have never so much as heard
of. Their whole life is passed in hunting and war. From
infancy they are inured to toil and hardship. The highest
praise is bestowed on those who remain the longest chaste: by
this course they consider their stature, strength, and sinews to
be most enhanced. All bathe, without distinction of sex, in
the rivers, and clothe themselves in skins, or small gar-
ments of deer-hides, thus leaving a large part of their bodies
exposed.

On agriculture they do not bestow much attention3 the chief
,part of their diet consisting in milk, cheese, and meat. None
have any fixed portion of the soil or lands to call their own3 but
