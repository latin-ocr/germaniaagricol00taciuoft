DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE.

porro praeter periculum horridi et ignoti maris, Asia aut
Africa aut Italia relicta, Germaniam peteret informem
terris, asperam coelo, tristem cultu aspectuque, nisi si
patria sit? Celebrant carminibus antiquis (quod unum
apud illos memoriae et annalium genus est) Tuistonem
deum terra editum, et filium Mannum, originem gentis

ocean showing a sort of active hos-
tility to navigators required a little
sostening down by an introductor-y
phrase. This boisterousness of the
German ocean appears to have
struck Tacitus: ef. A. ii. 94,
“ quanto violentior cetero mari ore-
anus et truculentia coeli praestat
Gerniania;'' and he has a similar
remark to the present one in c, 34
of this book, “sed obstitit Oceanus
in se inquiri.” The Romans ecr-
tainly had not much ens·0111·a‘,'em(²nt
in navigating these seas: the ‹lis-
asten-s Germanicus met with, and
the. alarniintg account of their hom-ors
his soldiers carried home. would
hardly indm-e traders to visit them.

visi si] Some of the MSS. have
‘nisi patria sit) which does not
appear to be right: for ‘ nisi si ³ ex-
presses the possibility of the occur-
rent-e of the matter in question3
whereas ‘nisi.q used ironic-ally in
the sense of ‘nisi forte,q does not
contemplate any such possstiility,
but the reverse.

carminibus] Of these old Teu-
tonic songs no speeimens have
survive‹l; and yet, indirectly, we
can form a pretty accurate idea of
their probable form and subjects.
Anglo-Saxon poenis have come
down; for iustam-e, the Adventures
of Beowulf. and the Trave'ler's
Song. the antiquity of which is
carried by some to the sixth or
seventh centurics after Christ; and
one may suppose them to bc fair
representatives of the mould in
which the earlier sonus of the race
were cast. If s0‚ in these verses
there was neither quantity nor
rhyme, but simply the recurrenoe,
within short distances, of similar

sounds or letters, either repeated in
the same or sucressive lines. This
will be seen at ons-e in a specimen
from the Traveller's Song‚ where
the alliterative letters are printed
iu Italics.-
OEtla weold Humum,
Enrmam-ie emtum,
Beeca Baningum,
Burgendum Gifica.
'rhe general character of these an-
cient poenis. as reum-ds matter, is
also ascertained from the two Ed—
das„ compiled in the eleventh and
twelfth eenturies by two Icelandic
scholars, Sigfusson and Snorro Stur-
lesen. and containing all that re-
mained of traditionary Scandinavian
mythology. They are. filled with
the adventures of the gods, Odin
and his sons, their battles against
the powers of evil, eiants. ἃς. (See
Oxford Essays for 1858, No. 5.)
Tm'slmzem] Although 1 have re-
tained this reading ont of deference
to the MSS.,yetI think‘ Tuisconem'
is very likely the true one. This
last word may be regarded as an ad-
jective, the ⁶ isk' belng the same as
our ‘ish' in ‘ selfishss and ⁵ Tui' or
‘ Tiu' being connected with ‘ Deus‚'
‘‹livus,¹ &c.‚ and appearing in the
Edda under the somn Tyr, Odin's
son, from whom our Tuesday de-
rives its appellation. Π
Asamum] This name is curi-
ously like the Hindoo Menu, the
Egyptian Menes, the Lydian Manes,
and the Cretan Minos. Probably it
is the same as the German Mensch,
and our ² man‚' and in it and Tuisco
humanity and divinity are per-
sonifled.
oriyz'nem yemis] It was the usual
custom of the nations of antiquity to
