position. Suetonius, οη the con-
t1··a1y (Julius caea-,11 25), under a
different view writes ‘omnem
Galliam in provinciae sorinam re-
de it.

{actisque} Raetia Proper, οι·
Prima, exxeudcd from the Helvetii
to Noricum, embracing the upper
portions of the valle3·s of the Licus
(Lech) Aenus (Iun), and Athesis
(Adige), the modern G risons T3 ¹101,
and part of Lombardy. Tacitus
seems to imlude under this name
Vindelici& or Raetia Secunda, be-
tween Raetia Prima and the Danube,
including· Southern Bavaria, and
WVurtemberg, and Noricum, east of
the Aenus (H. iii 5), as far as the
Mons Cetius (the Kahienbum ),
comprising the molem Salzburg and
Carinthia. Pe1h21ps,as Dr. Latham
suggests, he reg r¹a1ded the whole as
forming onl3 one ethnologic¹ al group,
and therefore mentioned them under
one name only.

Pannoniis] The country occupied
by this people stretched from Mons
Cetius to the Danube near its
junction with the Tibiscus (Theiss)‚
and from the Danube ln the Notth
to the Savus (Save) in the South,
comprising Oroatia, Carniola, Bos-
nia, Slavonia, XVestern Hungary,
Styria. and part of Lower Austria.
It was divided into Upper and Lower
Pannonia, west and east respec-
tively ofthe Arrabo (Raab).

Sarmatis] This race occupied
the vast resrion between the Vistula
and the Tanais (Don) embracing
modern Poland, East Prussia, Li-
thuania, and Russia. These people
are described by Pliny (vi. 7) as
‘ Medorum ut ferunt sobole33' and
from an examination of theii¹ lan-
guage they are supposed to belong
to the Indo· Germanic family. In
the time of Herodotus they were
on the left bank of the Don,
and gradually advanced westwmaid

The name disappears from histoiy

after the third century, and is re-
placed b3¹ that of si· axi, Sl: ivini, &c. ,
the modern Slawonic race, now
spread more or less over Polaud,
Russia‚ Oroatia, Carinthia, Styria,
Bohemia. &a

Duris-que] then Dacia became
a Roman province, after the con-
quests of Trajan, its boundaries
were the Tibiscus on the west,
and the Hierasus (Pi-uth) on the
East, while it strctched from the
Mons Carpatus to the Danube;
thus comprising lVallachia, Tran-
sylvania, Moldavia, and Eastern
Huugary.

mutuo metu] W here there is no
piu Sic1l boundary betueen the Ger-
mans on the one hand and Dacians
and Saimatians on the other, they
still foi-bear to molest each other,
each being afraid to attack the other.
In other quarters they are εθριιτα*εᾶ
by mountain chains, the Carpathians
forming a barrier between the Ger-
mans and §aimatlans and the Medves
range and the Bakonyer Wald, be-.
tween the former and the Da icians.

lztos sinus] ‘Embracing in its
range broad peninsulas and vast in-
sular tracts.' ‘Sinus' is ιι term for
any thing that is gathered into a
sold or makes ιι bend, and most com-
monly is used for gulfs bays, and the
like, but also for projecting head-
lands where the boundary line makes
a sweep. Tacitus here seems to
speak of the Danish peninsula,
Holstein, Sleswig‚ and Jutland.
The word comes to mean any distant
nook οι· corner, as c. 29ι sinus im-
perii, andin Agric. 23,‘ omnispropior
sinus Britanniae.' The‘ insularum
spatia,⁹ are no doubt arnougst others
Seeland, Funen, Norway and Swe-
den, ·
Scandinavian peninsula to be an
island Cf. Plinius iv, 27, “qui
(sinus) Codanus vocatur, refertus

insulis, quarum clarissima Scandi-
navia est.''
