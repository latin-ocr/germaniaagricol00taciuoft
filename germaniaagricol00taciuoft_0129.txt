inferences, drawn from supposed re-
semblances, the ancients did not care
much for Ethnological researches.
They were content to acquiesce in
the account each people gave of itself,
and of course barbarous tribes would
be able to give very little account of
themselves. Hence Tacitus says,
“ut inter barbaros parum comper-
tum.'' Really the classical nations
of antiquity knew about as little of
their own ultimate extraction as of
that of any other people, having made
no progress in analyses of various
languages. No doubt the earliest
known inhabitants of Britain were
Keltic, whether οἳ the Gaelic di-
vision or Kymric being uncertain·,
although the former supposition on
some grounds seems more probable.
In this case they were pressed North-
wards by the invading Kymri, just
as these last were themselves-sub-
sequently displaced by Teutonic
races.

rutilae . . . Germanicam orzjqinem]
There are no doubt some reasons,
more or less strong, in the eyes ot'
different Ethnologists for considering
a ortion at least of the inhabitants
opraledonia of Teutonic or Norse
origin. However, it is not essential
for the truth of the writer's de-
snm‘ption of the physical peculiarities
of the people, to have the question
settled one way or the other. His
account suits the Keltic character-
istics just as well as the Teutonic.

Caledoniam] This word is sup·
posed by many to be derived from
ech-dd, pl. Celeddon, a woody shel-
ter. The term originally seems to
have been restricted to a small part
of modern Scotland, extending from
Lech Fyne to the Murray Frith.

Agricola appears to have extendcd
the name to all the peoplc North of
the Grampians, or even the Friths of
Clydc and Forth.

Silarum colorati vultus] This has
nothing to do with Caesar's remark
(v. 14) about the Britons staining
their bodies. It means ‘ dark-huedss
just as in virgil, Georg. iv. 293, the
Indians are called ‘coloratis It is
by no means impossible, one may
think, that there should have been
colonies thrown off by the lberians
of Spain, in the way Tacitus men-
tions. The Silures occupied the
valley of the Severn, in South Wales,
Herefordshire, and West worcester·
shire.

Iberos] These people are a great
puzzle to Ethnologists. Inhistoric
times they occupied the Spanish
Peninsnla throughout its chief parts,
and were the lincal ancestors of the
Basqnes of the Pyrences. According
to the common theory they were
pressed on by the Keltic immigra-
tions and displaced. In another
vieW, the Kelts were the original
occupiers of Spain, and were ejected
by the inroads of the Iberi from the
South and East ofthe Peninsnla. I
suppose in either case, dispossessed
or adventurous Iberi may have
visited these islands. At any rate
there is a persistent tradition amongst
the ancients of the peopling of some
part of Britain and Ireland from the
Spanish coast.

trajecisse] ‘ Trajiccre' is used in
more constructions than one: .1.¹²
occurs as an active verb, as μιν. 11.
ll, “Ut praedatum milites trans
flumen per occasiones trajiceret ;''
and as a neuter verb, Liv. x'xx. 24,
