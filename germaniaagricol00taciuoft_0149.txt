ruptum facti testem habebat. Apud quosdam acerbior in
conviciis narrabatur: ut erat bonis comis, ita adversus
malos injucundus3 ceterum ex iracundia nihil supererat :.
secretum et silentium ejus non timeres: honestius puta-

XXIII.v Quarta aestas obtinendis quae percurrerat,
insumpta: ac si virtus exercituum et Romani nominis
gloria pateretur, inventus in ipsa Britannia terminus,
Nam Clota et Bodotria diversi maris aestibus per im-
mensum reveetae, angusto terrarum spatio dirimuntur,
quod tum praesidiis firmabatur: atque omnis propior

Sipus tenebatur, summotis velut in aliam insulam hos-
ti us.

of these last officers to a legion
(whence χιλίαρχος is the Greek
terni for tribune», and plobably six
‘praefects' in the corresponding
force of allies.

secretum et silentium ejus] Tacitus,
one would think. is here conti-asting
Agricola with· Domitian, who was
just at this very time raised to the
imperial throne. Of him he re-
marks, c. 39, “ Talibus curis exer—
citus, quodque saevae cogitationis
indicium erat, secreto suo satiatus‚''
διο. ‘Secretum' here, as in c. 39,
nfieans a moody brooding over any
t in .

XgXIII. obtinendis qnae percur-
rerat] ‘Obtinere' is ‘to continue
holding? ‘to maintain3' as in Liv.
i. 16Ἶ “Romana pubes maestum
silentium obtinebat.'' Agric. 24,
“Debellari obtinerique Hiberniam
posse.'' The sentence therefore
means, ‘The fourth summer was
spent in permanently taking inea-
sures to maintain ground which
before he had only rnn over.'

si virtus . . . pateretur] This is
not quite the sanie thing as if Ta-
citus had written ‘passa fnisset.'
This last reading would mean ⁶ if
the bravery of our armies had then
permitted.' The reading in the
text speaks not of a single time, but
makes a general hypothesis, ‘ If the
bravery of our armies could ever

allow such a things Agricola had
before crossed the Bodotria towards
the Tay. Aftcrwards passing the
Clota, he turned Westwards.

in ipsa Britannia . . . lVam esne]
By ⁶ Britain itsclf,' hc means Britain
on this side of the Fritlis2 for owing
to the distance inland these estnarics
penetrate, the all bnt isolated country
north of them may be regarded as a
different island.

reret-lue] Tacitus speaks of the
Clota and Bodotria as ‘carried back,'
because the watcrs of these river
mouths on their discharge into the
ocean, on the chstern and Eastern
coasts (ι diversi maris ’), arc driven
back by the sea waves, and made to
retrace their course inland. Cf.
Pliny (Epist. iv. 30), ‘⁴ Ut flumina
quae in mare deferuntur, adversan-
tibus ventis obvioque aestu retor—
quentur.”

atque omnis propior sinus] This
means thc whole shore, with its
projccting nooks, in the vicinity of
the Isthmus, East and chst, on its
Southern or English side. A wall,
called Grahain's D) kc, of which
remains exist, was built by Lollius
Urbicus, in the reign of Antoninus,
no doubt on pretty much the sanie
linc as Agricola's. from old Kirk-
patrick on the Clyde to Abercorn
on the Frith of F orth.
