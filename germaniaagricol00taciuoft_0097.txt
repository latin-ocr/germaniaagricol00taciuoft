que interlucent, quae implicata humore mox durescente

vicini solis radiis expressa atque liquentia, in proximum
mare labuntur ac vi tempestatum inadversa litora

nonia to Carnuntum on the Danube,
and thence conve-ved by the Veneti
to the shores of the Adriatic.

quae vicini solis effa] The rela-
tive here has no antecedent to refer

misintcrpretation of these words has
given rise to lhe notion of Tacitus
that a queen rules the Sitones.

sed ctiam α servitute] Elsewhere
slaves, however dem-aded as in Ori-

to except ‘nemora lucosque.' Of
course Tacitus means it to refer to
the gums which exude from them.
These gums are drawn out by the
action of the sun, near to them when
he siuks into the West. They are
carried by the ocean currente to the
opposite shores, the far North-east-
ern coasts.

labuntur] Ernesti reads ‘laban-
tur,' in which case, putting a comma
only after ‘ crediderim,' the passage
ma be translated ‘so Ι should be
inc ined to believe, that in the is-
lands and lands of the West there
are certain bodies which fall: ἃς.

Sitonum] Probably they dwelt
north of the Suiones in modern
Queenland. There is a. curious ex-
planation of the fact here mentioned
of a woman's rule over these pcople,
quoted in Dr. Latham's Germania.
The native name of the Finns of
Finland is Qvaen3 the Swedish
name for woman is ‘ quinna.' Some

ental countries„ are still ruled by
men, and arc not therefore sunk so
low as these Sitones, who are ruled
by awoman. Yet in the Agricola
he mentions without any remark of
astonishment, that the British are
ruled by kings and queens respective—
ly. Perhaps Tacitus is only repro-
ducing the sentiments of the Ger-
man sources whence he derived his
infommtion.

kings of Macedonia, and thus

make them Germans, others Gauls,
