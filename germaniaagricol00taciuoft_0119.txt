disposed Roman official of rank in
any scheme of mischief he might
put his hand to (oficio. ad Frat. i. l),
or bribe him to pervert justice.

dissimulationem] This word ene-
rally means to disguise what be ongs
to oneself. Tacitus however uses
it in the sense of conniving at the
faults of others. Cf. H. i. 26,
“Etiam apud integros dissimulatio
erat;'' aud A. xiii. 49, “ magnarum
rerum curam non dissimulaturos
qui animum etiam levissimis ad-
verterent?

in subsidium] Wex makes this
refer to the enactment os the Lex
Papia Poppaea, wherehy a candidate
with children was preferred to one
without, and one with more children
to one with fewer. ButI think it
only implies that Agricola having
lost a. son, the birth of a daughter
was a prop to his house, and a. solare
in his sorrow for the death of the
first child.

Mox inter fin] By a law passed
by Tappulus, B.c. 180, certain ages
were fixed, at which each office in
the state might be held. These
periods appear to have been for the
Quaestorship 30; for the T ribunate
33; for the Aedileship 363 for the
Praetorship 392 and for the Con-
sulate 42 or 43: so that two years
elapsed between successive offices.
Under the Caesare this arrange-
ment was altered; and besides the
Quaestorship being obtainable at 24,
a. year only seems to have elapsed
between successive honours; for
the ellipse here must be ‘annum'

To supply ‘biennium' would bc
extremely harsh.

jurisdictio] There were many
Praetors at Rome at this period3
but only two. who filled the places
of the old Praetor Urbanus and
Praetor Peregrinus, had the ‘jus
dicendis The others presided over
the Quaestiones perpetuae, for ‘re-
petundae,' ‘ambitus‚' &m Under
the emperors these last cases came
practically under the cognizance of
the Senate (A. iv. 6). Tacitus
therefore correctly says, ‘idem prae-
turae tenor et silentium)

The ‘jurisdictio' herc spoken of
included the appointment of a
‘judex' (after preliminary pro-
ceedings before the Praetor in per-
son), and the giving him the formula
containing his instructions. A part
of his duty was also the ⁴ addictio,'
whereby in certain cases he adjudged
the property in question to one of
the litigants. These functionis are
referred to in the ‘tria verba' of
Ovid: “ille nefastus erit per quem
tria verba silebunt.''

obvenerat] ⁸ Obvenire. ¹ is ‘to come
across any one by chauces ‘to fall
in his way ς’ generally used of any
thing falling to his share by lot,—
a province, for instance, as here.
Cf. Caesar, B. C. i. 6. “Provinciae
decernuntur; Seipioni obvenitSyria.”

Ludos el inmn'a honoris] Under
the Republic the Cui-ule Aediles had
the care of the public shows. Au-
gustus, about Rc. 20, transferred
this duty to the l'raetors.
