INTRODUCTION. 7

added to those I have already mentioned the Luji, a powerful
people, and the Zumi, and ButoneS, and Mugilones‚ and Sibini,
and the Semnones, a large tribe of the Sueri. As Ι remarked
before, the Suevic peoples dwelt partly within and partly without
the forest, contiguous to the Getae. 'Now the greatest nation is
the suevia, for it stretches from the Rhine to the Elbe, and part
of it is situated even beyond the Elbe3 the Hermondori, for
instance, and the Langosargi3 but at the present time these
last have been expelled entirely beyond that river. A common
feature in all these peoples is their facility in remex-ing their
abodes, a facility arising from the scantiness of provisions, and
the absence of agriculture, or the accumulation of wealth. They
dwell in huts, satisfying their wants from day to day, living
chiefly on their herds of cattle, like the Nomade races; in
imitation of whom they place their households in waggons, and
with their cattle wandel· whererer it seems best. There are
other German tribes inferior to these3 the Cherusci, Chatti,
Gamabrivii, and Chattuarii3 on the shores of the ocean are the
Sugambri and Chaubi, and Bructeri and Cimbri, Cauci, Caulci‚
Campsiani, a'nd many others. In the same direction as the
Ems fiow the Weser and Lippe3 the latter some 600 stadia
distant stom the Rhine, running through the Lesser Bructeri.
There is also the river Sala, between which and the Rhine, in
the midst of great successes in war, Drusus Germanicus died.
This general conquered not only the greater part of the various
tribes, but sixteen islands along the coast as well, one of which
is Burchanis, which he laid siege to and took. The Rhine is
about 3000 stadia distant from. the Elbe, in a direct line3 but
one is compelled to make a circuit, through tortuous and marshy
roads and forests. The Hercynian forest is thickly wooded and
overgrown with large trees, covering ground of vast extent,
strongly fortified by nature. In the centre of it lies the habit-
able region already described. Near it are the sources of the
Danube and the Rhim, and the lake between them, and the
marshes formed by the Rhine. ΤῙιε circuit of the lake is more
than 300 stadia, and the distance across nearly 200. In this
¹lake is an island, used by Tiberius as the base of his naval
operatione against the Vindelici. It, as well as the Hercynian
forest, lies south of the sources of the Danube ; consequently, in
