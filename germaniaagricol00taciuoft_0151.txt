AGRICOLAE VITA. 13'7

mercia et negotiatores cogniti. Agricola expulsum sedi-
tione domestica unum ex regulis gentis exceperat, ac
specie amicitiae in occasionem retinebat. Saepe ex eo
audivi, legione una et modicis auxiliis debellari obtineri-
que Hiberniam posse. quue etiam adversus Britanniam
profuturum, si Romana ubique arma, et velut e conspectu
libertas tolleretur. ·

XXV. Ceterum aestate, qua sextum officii annum
inchoabat, amplexus civitates trans Bodotriam sitas, quia
motus universarum ultra gentium, et infesta hostilis exer-
citus itinera timebantur, portus classe exploravit: quae
ab Agricola primum adsumpta in partem virium, seque-
batur egregia specie, cum simul terra, simul mari bellum
impelleretur, ac saepe iisdem castris pedes equesque et
nauticus miles, mixti copiis et laetitia, sua quisque facta,
suos casus attollerent: ac modo silvarum et mon·

abruptis saxis aut per occulta vada
infestas.'' An easier reading is
⁸ exercitui hostili ς’ but this is more
like the correction ofa copyist trying
his hand on conjectural emendation.
The words from ‘quia' to ‘time-
bantur' give the reason why Agri-
cola was accouipanied by his fleet.

in occasionem retinebat] Agricola
kept the chief to make a pretext
out of him for meddling in the
affairs of Ireland. ln much the
same way Claudius liarboured Be-
ricus, and at his instigation, under
11³3retence of restoring him, invaded

ritain.

debellari] This compound answers
to the Greek καταπολεμεῖσθαι, to
be warred down, or completely sub-
jugated.

XXV. ampleoeus] The ellipse is
‘bello‚’ or ‘castelliss or a similar
word. Cf. c. 17, ‘⁴ Magnamque
Brigantum partem aut victoria am-
plexus est aut be110.'' The region
so embraced was Fife‚ Perth, Angus,
1andd the Eastern side of the High-
an s.

irgfesta hostilis exercilus itinera] If
this reading be correct, the genitive
depende on ‘itinerass and ‘hostilis
exercitus' is used of a hostile army
generally. and incidentally here, of
the Roman army. Agricola was
afraid lest the routes that any at·
tacking force, and therefore his own
army must take, should be beset.
‘Infesta' is used in the sense of
‘infestata‚' asin A. ii. 23, “ insulas

He did not venture to march directly
inland over the Isthmus, for sear
of being entangled amidst hostile
tribes, without any support. He
probably, therefme, kept within a
moderate distance of the Eastem
shore, and his fleet coasted along at
the sanie time, so that in ease of
extremity he could receive pro-
visions or succours, or retire on
ship-board.

mixti copiis] This is a curious
expression, not however uncom-
monly found. Those whose provi-
sions, &c.,were enjoyed in common,
are said to be mixed with the
provisions, &c. So in H. i. 9,
“Exercitus nec vitiis nec viribus
miscebantur,'' their vices and
strength were not mutually im-
parted by one to the other. Also,
A. xi. 24, “ (Galli) jam moribus,
artibus, adfinitatibus nostris mixti.''
