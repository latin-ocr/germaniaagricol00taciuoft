108 AGRICOLAE VITA.

VIII. Praeerat tunc Britanniae Vettius Bolanus, pla-
cidius, quam feroci provincia dignum est: temperavit
Agricola vim suam, ardoremque compescuit, ne in-
cresceret3 peritus obsequi, eruditusque utilia honestis
miscere. Brevi deinde Britannia consularem Petilium
Cerialem accepit. Habuerunt virtutes spatium exem·
plorum. Sed primo Cerialis modo labores et discrimina,
mox et gloriam communicabat: saepe parti exereitus in
experimentum, aliquando majoribus copiis ex eventu
praefecit: nec Agricola unquam in suam famam gestis
exsultavit3 ad auctorem et ducem, ut minister, fortunam
referebat. Ita virtute in obsequendo, verecundia in prae-

dicando, extra invidiam nee extra gloriam erat.

way of contrasting his own energy
and strictness with the lnose dis-
cipline of his predecessores, chose
rather to begin by blotting out the
past, and treating them as respect-
able characters. He thus appealed
to their better feelings.

VIII, <leynam est] Tacitus uses
‘ est,' not ⁴ erat,' because he is speak-
ing generally, not of Britain par-
ticularly. Bolanus governed Britain
more inertly than suits any province
where the people are only halfcon-
quered.

ne incresceret] I think the ‘nomi-
native case to this is *urdorf lValther
quotes a passage from Suetonius to
prove that it means ‘super aliquem
adsurgere? De Inlust. Gram. e. 3,
“post hoc magis ac magis et gratia et
cura artis increvit ;” a passage which
lseems, to me to prove nothing of the
'ind.

peritus obsequi] virgil (Eclog. x.
32)has ‘soli cantare periti Arcades„'
and Persius (ii. 34), ⁶ Urentes oculos
inhibere perita‚' but this infinitive is
poetical. There are other instances
of poetica] infinitives: A. xiv. 56,
“factus natm-a et consuetudine ex-
ercitus velare 0‹linm.'' A. iv 5⁴2,
“properus quoquo facinore clares-
cere.” A. ii. 57, “atrox et mani-
festus dissentire.” The usual prose
constructions would be ‘peritus ob—

sequendi? ‘factus ad velandum: ‘ma-
nifestus ‹lisseuticndi.' The use of tho
infinitive is one point in which
Tacitus differs very much from the
Augustan writers: for instance, he
uses it after ‘impello ’ (A. xiii. 19),
‘praecipio' (Agric. 38), ‘posco ' (A.
iii. 19), ‘orare' (A. xiii. 13), ⁸ mo-
neo' (A. xii. 46), ‘suadeo' (A. xiii.
37), and after ‘perpulit' very com-
monly. This practice of course is
not to be copied,

Petilium Cerialem] Cerialis had
once been lieutenant of the 9th
legion in Britain, under Suetonius
Paulinus. He was connected by
marriage with Vespasian and was one
of his generals in the civil war. He
was engaged in the capture of Rome,
and was afterwards despatched into
Germany to oppose Civilis and the
Batavi. He appears to have died
during his command in Britain.

in suam samam] ‘with a view
to increase his own reputation.' Cf.
c. 18, “ nec Agricola prosperitate
rerum in vanitatem usus expedi—
tionem ant victoriam vocabat victos
continuisse.''

nec eaetra yloriam] ‘ Nec ' is often
put in this way for ‘ et non.’ Cf. A.
iv. ll, “verisneqne in miraculum
cnrruptis.” Also Cic. ad Attio. iii.
17, and Liv. iii. 55.
