GNAEI JULII AGRICOLAE VITA.

Ι. CLARORUM virorum facta moresque posteris tradere
antiquitus usitatum, ne nostris quidem temporibus quan-
quam incuriosa suorum aetas omisit, quotiens magna
aliqua ae nobilis virtus vicit ao supergressa est vitium,
parvis magnisque civitatibus commune, ignorantiam recti
et invidiam. Sed apud priores, ut agere digna memoratu
pronum, magisque in aperto erat3 ita celeberrimus quis-

I. incuriosa suorum aelus] ⁶ Incu-
riosus' is afavourite word of Tacitus
(cf. A. ii. 883 iv. 323 xv. 31. H.i.
49), not found in the Augustam
writers, but common in his contem-
poraries. The eommentators com—
pare such passages as Dialog. de
Orat. 18, “Vitio antem maligni-
tatis humanae vetera semper in laude,
praesentia in fastidio esse ;'' and A.
ii. 88, “dum vetera extollimus, re-
centium incu1·1osi.'' But I ‹lo not
see much connexion between such
passages and the present. Tacitus
does not appear to say that great nien
have not been celebrated because the
age they lived in was envious of
them3 one would suppose such a
feeling to exist as much at one time
as another, and not in the age of
Tacitus especially. I rather think a
parallel remark is conveyed in Ju-
venal's description of his own day
(x. 77), “ex quo suffragia nulli
vendimus‚effudit curas;” and Tacitus
means that the age 11 as grown careless
of all that appertains to its own
times. This would be a natural result
of the Imperial rulo.

vicit ac superyressa est] The first
word merely gives the idea of over-
coming, the second adds the notion
of mounting over the body of the
prostrate enemy. “

commune, ζα] ‘equally shared
by small and great states) ‘Com—
munis ' is that which belongs to the
‘munus‚' or duty of many3 ‘vul-
garis' is that which exists amongst
the ‘vnlgus,' and thence expresses
what is generally prevalent.

priores] By this word Tacitus
designates those who lived while
there was still aconstitutional govern-
ment at Rome, under the Repub-
lici Cf. A. iii. 55, xi. 2⁴, and H.
1. .

pronum, magisque in operto erat]
‘Pronus' is used for any thing sloping
downwards, and it repuesents the
facility of a down-hill course. Cf.
c. 33, ‘omniaque prona victoribus?
‘ In aperto esse* occurs in Sallust
(Jug. 5) to denote what is disclosed
to view clearly, “ pauca supra repetam
quo ad cognoscendum omnia illustria
magis, magisque in aperto sint.”
This however is certainly not the
