DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE. 75

tumque in eo vehiculum veste contectum, attingere uni
sacerdoti concessum. Is adesse penetrali deam intelligit,
vectamque bubus feminis multa cum veneratione prose-
quitur. Laeti tune dies, festa loca, quaecunque adventi?
hospitioque dignatur. Non bella ineunt, non arma
sumunt, clausum omne ferrum: pax et quies tunc tan-
tum nota, tunc tanturn amata, donee idem sacerdos satia-
tam conversatione mortalium deam templo reddat: mox

vehiculum et vestes, et, si credere velis, numen ipsum
secreto lacu abluitur. Servi ministrant, quos statim idem

lacus haurit.

Arcanus hinc terror sanctaque ignorantia,

other Slaronic nations worshipped,
—and Heligoland‚ at the mouth of
the Elbe, for the Anglii and Teu-
touie nations. The name of Holy
Island, aud the use of the word
‘oceanus‚' although the term may
be applied to the Bahic, are both
somewhat in favour of this view.
‘Oceanus' in this case, of course,
is the Northern Ocean. ln Rugen
there is still a dense wood in one
quarter of the island.

castum nemus] The adjective
‘castus’ is more usually the epithet
of a person than a thing. However,
the poets use it in the latter way3
Horace. for instance (i. 12. 60), “tu

ucis.

penetrali] This word is connected
with ‘ penitus‚' and means the inner
recess of a house or temple, where
the statue of the deity was placed.
Here it is used sor the car, and its
coneriug, aa the abode of the di-
vinity.

The goddess here is, in Ritter's
view, the Isis spoken of in e. 9,
the identification being grounded on
similarity of attributes. lf so, the
tar would be a boat on wheels pro-
bably. In the twelfth century there
is mentioned a similar provession
amongst the people of the Lower
Rhine, in which a boat was pushed

along on wheels. At Rome, on the
third day before the Noues of March,
a bo·t was offered to lsis at the
beginning of the sailing season, the
day itself being called Navigium
Isidis. Ritter considers the actual
name of the godam to be Hertha,
but 1 ‹lo not see this to be necessary.
The real name may have been
Frigga, or Frea. wife of Wodan,
and uiother of the gods, and Hertha
may simply be the word ¹ earth? as
the scene of the main influencc of
that goddess. the Egyptian lsis, Rhea,
Ops, and Cybele filling the same
place in the classical mythology.

si credere velis, numen] By this
it is clear that Tacitus means to
imply that the goddess herself un—
derwent ablutions, not the image of
the go‹l‹less; for in fact there does
not seem to have beeu one. The
priests believed, or wished others to
helieve‚—not appatently succeeding
in the case of the writer himself,—
that the goddess was actually present
in the cart. The temple mentioned
in this account was no doubt a
sacred enclo-ure or grove, not any
actual building, uhu-h elsewhere he
declares not to have existed.

to the Danube and the Roman
provinces along its right bank,
