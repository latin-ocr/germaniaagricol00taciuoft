Tencteri super solitum bellorum decus, equestris disci-

One can hardly help thinking that
the Rhine must be ‘certus alveo*

Usipii ac Tencteri] According to
caesar, these tribes being expelled
from their abodes by the Suevi. after
three years' wandering seized the
lande of the Menapii, between the
Rhine and the Moselle. After their
conquest by Caesar, the survivors
took refuge amongst the Sugambri,
and on the removal of the latter to
Gaul, occupied their scats near the
Luppia (Lippe). Afterwards the Usi -
pii moved South between the Sieg
and the Lahn: the Tencteri settled
between the Sieg and the Ruhr.

XXXIII. Bructeri] The Bruc-
mi are mentioned by Tacitus (A.

probably the lVetterwald. They are
said by Velleius paterculus to have
been conquered by Tiberius3 but
they appear to have taken a part in
the battle of the Saltus Teutober—
giensis, as a Roman eagle was found
amongst them. Their entire de-
struction by other German tribes
mentioned below can hardly be
otherwise than an exaggeration, for
they are afterwards mentioned by
Pliny and Ptoleniy as defeated
by Spurinna in Trajan's reign 3 and
under the slightly varied names of
Burcturi and Brictcri occur in the
Itineraries and Sulpicius Alexander3
being ranked by the last as menibcrs
of the Frank confederacy. Tho
battle Tacitus mentions here must
have taken place between Ap. 70
and 983 for they arc mentioned
(H, iv. 21) as taking part in the
revolt of Civilis, and thc last dato is
the year when Tacitus wrote his
Germania.

Chamavi] According to Tacitus
