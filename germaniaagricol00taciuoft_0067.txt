Verberare servum ac vinculis et opere

coercere, rarum. Occidere solent, non disciplina et seve-
ritate, sed impetu et ira, ut inimicum, nisi quod impune.
Liberti non multum supra servos sunt, raro aliquod
momentum in domo, nunquam in civitate, exceptis
duntaxat iis gentibus, quae regnantur. Ibi enim et super
ingenuos et super nobiles ascendunt: apud ceteros, im-
pares libertini libertatis argumentum sunt.

the corn or cattle for consumptiun,
or materials for the. dress of his
master: these may without any im-
propriety be called ‘officia domus,'

ecause connected with the house-
hold management. All other dutics
of the homestead the master's own
wife and children perform, and with
them the serf has no concern. Or
the phrase may be like one in
H. iv. 56. “legatis tantum legio-
num interfectis ceterum vulgus . . .
facile accessurum ;” so that the
words will he equivalent to ‘ceter-a,
sc. quaecunque domus officia sunt,'
&ta In either case the house is the
hlouse of the master, not of the
s ave.

Occidere solent . . . . impune] In
this respect the usage of the Ger-
mane and the Romans seems to
have been'the same. Under the
republic the law hardly appears to
have interfered at all with the power
of a. master over his slave. Under
the emperor& however, enactnients
were at different times passed to
restrict the severity of punishment
arbitrarily inflictcd. In the other
point mentioned here, ‘verberare
. . . . rarum‚’ there was a decided
eontrast to the Roman treatment3
for the lash was in such frequent
. use, that the slaves professed often
to have given up caring for it, and
the ‘ lorarii' are represented as worn
' out with flogging to no purpose.
Cf. Plaut. Asin. iii. 2. 29, ‘⁵ Ubi
saepe ad languorem tua duritia
dederis ueto validos lictores ulmeis
affectos lentis virgis.''

Liberti} At the end of the chapter
Tacitus uses ‘libertini ς’ and one

expects to find some reason for
the difference. Generally speaking
⁸ libertus' designates a manumitte—(1
slave, viewed with reference to his
late masten while ‘ hbertinus' de-
notes his social position. Conse-
quently Ernesti wants to alter
‘libertus' here into ‘libertinus‚'
as he does in many other passages:
for instance, in H. i. 46. It does
not however seem unlikely that
when conti-asted as here with ⁶ ser-
i·us‚' ‘libertus’ may be used pur-
posely. The word ‘ servus' of
necessity brings up the idea of
‘domimus and with reference to
him, ‘ libertus* would navumlly sug-
gest itself, and not ⁵ libertinus¹ On
the other hand, when the free-born
are contrasted with freedmen, and no
idea of a master is introduced, ‘li-
bertini' would be the natural term
to use, as below, and in A. xiii. 27.
“ si separarentur libertini, manifes-
tam fore penuriam ingenuorum.”

There may be also. I think, a
different view taken of the matter.
At the court of the Roman ern-
perors the powerful freedmen would
be influentia] in their chamcter of
‘liberti' rather than ⁸ libertini)
that is, simply as individuals still
attached to their old master's person.
As Tacitus had this in view when
he wrote, ‘liberti' would be the
word naturally occurring to his
mind. At the end of the chapter,
when he is describing the inferiority
of their social position, he uses the
proper word, ‘ libertinus*

manantur] ‘ are rulcd by kings.'
Cf. H. i. 16, and A. xiii. 54.
