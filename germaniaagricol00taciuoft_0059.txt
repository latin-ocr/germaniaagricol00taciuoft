DE MORIBUS

poena praesens et maritis permissa.

GERMANIAE. 45

Aceisis crinibus,

nudatam, coram propinquis, expellit domo maritus ac
per omnem vicum verbere agit ε publicatae enim pudicitiae
nulla venia: non forma, non aetate, non opibus maritum

invenerit.

Nemo enim illic vitia ridet: nee corrumpere
et eorrumpi seculum vocatur.

Melius quidem adhue

eae civitates,·in quibus tantum virgines nubunt, et eum
spe votoque uxoris semel transigitur. Sic unum accipiunt:

not seem possible to form any tole-
rably accurate idea of the numbers
' of the German people. Caesar men-
tions that the Suevi were divided
into 100 cantens, and sent out yearly
from each a force of 1000 fighting
men. Ariovistus himself was at the
head of a mixed force of 120„000
warriors. The Usipetes and Tencteri,
two tribes dispossessed by the Suevi,
are numbered by Caesar (iv. 15)
at 430,000‚ and Tacitus (Germ. 33)
speaks of the slaughter of 60‚000
men in a war between two tribes.
These numbers .convey the idea
that in spite of the great porticus
of land covered with woods and
mountaius, the population was
really considerable. Comparing the
sizes of Gaul and Germania, and
caesar's statement of the total
number of nien conquercd by him-
selfin the subjugation of the former
country, one may perhaps hazard a
rough guess that six or seven mil-
lions represented the population of
Get-many.

Aeo-isis cm'nibus] The compound
‘accidere' means ‘to cut deep
int0‚' and in this ease therefore ⁸ to
cut short) Livy (viii. 29) uses it
metaphorically in the sense of cut-
-ting a people's resources all to
shreds.

seculum vocatur] ‘nor is mutual
corruption called the spirit of the

age.' For a similar use compare
Martial ix. 28:

“Cui-ios, Camillos, Quintius, Nu-
mas, Ancos,
Loqueris, sonasque grandibus
minax verbis,

Et *cuin theatris seculoque rixa-
r1s.

That is, ‘you inveigh against the
theatres, and the manners of the
timess

Alelius quidem adhuc] This ellipse
of ‘ageres or ‘facere,' is not un-
common. Cf. A. i. 43, “ melius et
amantius ille qui gladium offere-
bat.'' Cf. also Agric. 19.

‘ Adhuc' is used in the sense of
‘still further,' ‘still more,' by the
later writers. Cf. Pliu. xxxiii. 2,
“sunt adhuc reliquae non omit-
tendae in auro differentiae.'‘ See
aho Agric.. 33. lt is naturally in
this meaning joined to comparatives 3
as in c. 29, ⁴* nisi quod adhuc acrius
animantur.” So Suetonius (Nero
10), “ut certiorem adhuc osteu-
deret.''

transiyitur] ‘they have done,
once sor all, with the hopes‚' &a
This use of the word comes natu-
rally from its original sense of
piel-cing a dart οι· qny weapon
through any obstacle, and so reaclv-
ing the exterior, or end of it. Cf.
Agris. 34, ‘transigite cum expe-
ditionibus.' This use of the word
is a late one.

This custom of the Germans
formed a contrast to the Roman
practice. Martial (vi. 7) complains
that in spite of the Julian law,
Telesina had married ten husbands
in thirty days. With them the
facilities for divorce seem to have
nearly rivalled those amongst the
Jews3 with whom a woman might
be divorced for spoiling her husband's
soup.
