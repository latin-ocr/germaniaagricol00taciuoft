Nerva Caesar] This seems to
furnish a clue to the date of the
Agricola. Nerva was deified im-
mediatelx after his death, which
took place at the end of January,
A. D. 98. 111 October, A. D 97 lie
adopted Trajan, and associated him
in power with himself under the
title of Imperator, and with the Tri-
bunitia potestas. In mentioning
Nerva here Tacitus does 1101 call
him divus' (‹e.f H. i. l, “Princi-
patum divi Nervae etimperium Tra-
jani senectuti seposui' ). The in-
ference is that Nerva was not- Jet
dead, and therefore the book must
hare been written between October,

so, of course there was no room for
any mention of Nerva

principatum] This is the term
generally used to express the rule of
the Roman emperors. The title by
which the sox ereign of 1118 world'was
mainly addressed is ‘princeps‚' or
‘princeps senatus?

men who had borne the office of
Censor, and convey ed the privilege
of speaking first in the debates of
the senate. It was therefore a con-

ceptable to the R'omans, who clung to
the form of libert) when the reality
had passed away. Tacitus here uses
the xpvord with great fitness, as Nerva
was not a warlike prince. The Ro-
man emperors were also, of course,
generalissimos of the entire armies
of the empire, but Trajan s rule
is called ‘ imperiumss not by rea-
son of the general fact here men·
