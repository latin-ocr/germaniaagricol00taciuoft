paratns simulatione] The ablative
is an instrumenta] one, ‘ arming him-
self with hypoci·isy.' Cicero uses
⁴ paratum esse peditatu' in the same
way. One MS. has ‘ simulationis‚'
a. common construction with Tacitus,
like ‘vetus regnandi}
orandi,' &a

in adrogantiam] Cf. H. i. 54,
‘legati in squalorem maestitiamque
compositi.' .

excusantis] In Dialog. de Orat.
c. 5 ‘excusare' is found without a
prououn3 but it seems most likely
that ‘ se' has disappeared from the
MSS. in such a sentence as ‘in
iis cogitationibus excusant? The
usage against this omission of the
ronoun seems all but universal.
l'zitter defends iton the ground of‘ex-
cusantis' being a participle used like
a noun3 a reason Ido not understand.
Cicero has ‘ excusatio obeundae lega-
tionis,' in the sense of declining a
‘legatio3' and I think. possibly the
word may be used here simply for · de-
clining,' and the accusative omitted
be ‘pi-ovinciam,’ gathered from the
whole context.

beneficii invidia] He did not blush
to undergo the odium that must

‘ validus

ensue from such a sham act of con-
cession to Agricola's wishes. So in
A. vi. 23, ⁶ Tiberius non erubuit
permittere‚' of a pretended favour
in allowing some one to be buried.

WVex takes the words to mean ‘ did
not blush to feel that he was satisfying
*his own malice, in the matter of this
pretended favour? I think the other
way right.

salarium tamen] This word is
derived by the ancients themselves
from ‘ sal,' meaning a supply of all
the necessaries of life, of which salt
is a representative ς and, beyond
this, a payment of money, which
under the emperors was usually made
to provincial governors. Dion Oas-
sius mentions that to Aufidius
Fronto was paid a suni of 10,000
sesterces to compensate him for tho
withbolding the provinces of Asia
and Africa from him.

inlicita mirari] Tacitus says, in
c. 17, “Julius Frontinus vir magnus,
quantum licebat.'' This seems the
clue to Tacitus' meaning here. Some
admire the boldncss and spirit of
those who aim at a freedom and in-
dependenee no longer possible to
attain, under the existing state of
