AGRICOLAE VITA.

donec Agricola Batavorum cohortes ac Tungrorum duas
cohortatus est, ut rem ad mucrones ac manus addu-
cerent: quod et ipsis vetustate militiae exercitatum, et
hostibus inhabile, parva scuta et enormes gladios geren-
tibus: nam Britannorum gladii sine mucrone complexum

armorum, et in arto pugnam non tolerabant.

A monumental stone, found in
Northumberland‚ commemoratos a
surgeon to the first cohort of the
Tungriaus in the following words:

Altars have been found also de-
dicated by soldiers of Batavian
colim-‚ts In fact, an immense num-
ber of foreign troops have left
records of their service in Britain.

Nervii Aquitani, V angiones Thraces,
and others are all commemorated
in inscriptions.

means is wll explained by xirgil
(Aen. x. 361):

‘Haud aliter Trojanae acies, acies-

It is not easy to gain a clear idea of

this battle from the description of
Tacitus. After many times reading
ονυ· 1118 passage I think what he
means is as follows: The Britons

'were posted on rising ground; the

level space between them and the
Romans was filled with‘ covinari i.'
As the Romans advanced these
‘covinarii’ dismounted (see c. 12),
and the ‘covini' were driven off
by the ‘aurigae' The Batavi and
Tungri overpowered these dismouuted
covinarii' (⁵stratis qui in aequo
adstiterant'), and with the other
allied coliorts began to mount the
hill, leaving many of the Britons
unwounded, or only half despatched
behind them. The Roman cavalry
pressed into the fray side by side
with their own infantry S‘turmae
equitum peditum 58 prce io mis-
cuere'). At first these hor-semen
caused a panic (ι recentem terrorem
intulerant'), but were soon brought
to a standstill by the enemy’s
ranl‘s and the rising ground (‘ densis
tamen hostiumf &c.). The fray
nas now no l'onger like a cavalry
engagement, with* charges at speed,
but a confiised medley. The co·
horts havinginsecure footing (aegre
stantes'), were pushed on from
behind by the strugoling horses of
the cavalrx and continually charged
on the flanks and in front by chance
