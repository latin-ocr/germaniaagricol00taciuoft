ratur, pulsis Bructeris ac penitus excisis, vicinarum
consensu nationum, seu superbiae odio, seu praedae dulce-
dine, seu favore quodam erga nos deorum: nam ne
spectaculo quidem proelii invidere: super Lx millia, non
armis telisque Romanis, sed, quod magnificentius est,
oblectationi oculisque ceciderunt. Maneat quaeso, duret-
que gentibuS‚ si non amor nostri, at certe odium sui:
quando, urgentibus imperii fatis, nihil jam praestare for-

tuna majus potest quarn hostium discordiam.

XXXIV. Angrivarios et Chamavos a tergo Dulgibini,

the Rhine, in a district afterwards
occupied by the Tubantes and Usi-
petes; afterwards they are found fur-
ther in the interior, in Osnaburg, and
part of Westphalia. They arc sub-
sequently enumcrated with other
tribes as members of the Frankish
lea e.

Ξῗιῃνίυανίί] The Angrivarii divelt
between the Bructeri and the Fosi,
on both sides of the Visurgis (Weser),
and extended eastwards almost to
the Albis (Elbe). They were se-
parated by a mound from the Che-
rusci on the South. In ΑΛ). 16,
they joined the Cheruscan league‚
and with their confederates were
defeated at Campus mistas-isus, per-
haps near Minden. Their name is
connected with ‘angen’ a meadmr,
and ⁸ware,' inhabitants3 and Engern,
in XVestplialim seems to point out
their locality, and preserve the
name.

spectaculo] The construction of
‘invidere' in the Augustan writers
is, a dative of the person, and an
accusative of that with reference to
which the envy is felt ς as, ‘⁴ ut nobis
optimam naturam invidisse vide-
antur.'¹ In the writers of the silver
aee, the construction is changed from
the accusative to the ablative. Quinc-
tilian says (ix. 3), ‘⁴ si antiquum ser-
monem nostro comparemus. paene
jam quidquid loquimur figura est, ut
‘hac re invideres non ut omnes
veteres et Cicero praecipue, hanc
xem.” (Cicero however has a kind

of intermediate form, “in qua tibi
invideo quod unis vestimentis lautus
esf) Cf. A. i. 22. ‘ne hostes qui-
dem sepultura in vident.'

oculisque] It was Spurinna and
his army, probably, who had the
good fortune to witness this carnage;
for Pliny the Younger speaks of
that general as having restored the
king of the Bructeri to his throne,
and cowed the tribe into submission.

umentibus] Livy (v. 36) uses this
word in the same way, ⁸ jam urgen-
tibus Romanam urbem fatis.' These
words were written at the beginning
of Trajan's reign, and before his
great military euterprises were un-
dertaken. The events which in-
duced Tacitus to speak thus gloomily
of the prospects of his country were
probably the rebellion of Civilis, and
the civil dissensione and reverses
under Domitian. See H. i. 2.

XXXIV. α ter-90 . . . claudunt]
These words must imply that the
Dulgibini and Chasuarii are South-
east of the Chamavi and Angri-
varii, judging from the other ex-
pression, ‘a fronte.' whic'n can only
mean on the North-west, from the
position of the Frisii along the coast.

Dnlyihini] The Dulgibini were
settled between the sources of the
Lippe and the WVeser, in Dctmold,
and about Paderborn. Ptolemy
places them across the YVeser, fur-
ther inland, but they probably moved
about a good deal between the two
ates.
