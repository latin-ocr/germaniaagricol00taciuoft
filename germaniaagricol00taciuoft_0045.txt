DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE.

et objectu pectorum, et monstrata cominus captivitate,
quam longe impatientius feminarum suarum nomine
timent: adeo, ut efficacius obligentur animi civitatum,
quibus inter obsides puellae quoque nobiles imperantur.
Inesse quin etiam sanetum aliquid et providum putant;
nee aut consilia earum aspernantur, aut responsa neg-

ligunt.

Vidimus sub diro Vespasiano Veledam, diu
apud plerosque numinis loeo habitam.

Sed et olim

Auriniam et complures alias venerati sunt, non adula-
tione nee tanquam facerent deas.

their husbands ; after these last were
disposed of. the wives killed the fngi-
tive soldiers‚and with swordsand axes
gave the Romans considerable trou-
ble before they were got rid of.

nomine] ‘on the score of3' cf.
H. i. 29, “non quia. meo nomine
paveam‚” and Horace iii. 21. 5,
“quocunque'lectum nomine Mas-
sicum servas. '

quibus inter obsides] Augustus
Caesar turned this peculiarity to a
useful account, and insisted on the
German tribes sending female hos-
tages. (Suet. Oct. 21.)

consilia ᾇτ’] These prescierit
women offered advice unasked (con-
silia), or in reply to questions put to
them (responsa). They determined,
amongst other things, when was the
lucky moment for giving battle.
(Plutarch's Lr'e of Caesar.)

Vidimus sub davo Vespasiano Ve-
ledam] The nse of the word ‘vi-
dimus' does not seem at all to prove
that Tacitus was ever in Germany
(see the Introduction), or that Ve-
leda was brought to Rome. Tacitus
only means that the case of Veleda
had fallen within his knowledge. A
man might very well say that within
the last two or thre-e years we had
seen Italy olitically rvg-nerated,
without imp ying that he had ac-
tually been present in the vountry.
The prophetess Veleda (Η. iv. 61)
belonged to the Bructeri, and dwelt
near the Lippe. She encouraged the
revolt of the Batavian chief, Civilis,

and was eventually taken prisoner by
the Romans. As for the name, the
Edda contains a poem called Voluspa‚
or the song of Vola, and the two
words probably have the sanie root.
She is mentioned by Statius (Silva
i. 4. 89), where the middle syllable
is short, although the Greek equi-
valent bas the long vowel.

Auriniam] One is inclined to
think Tacitus made a proper name
out of a term applied to a whole
class, and that ‘ Aurinia* represents
the ¹ Ali-unae: as the Goths teruied
their inspired women. There is an
oracular maiden, Ganna, mentioned
by Dion Cassius, and a Chattan
prophetess is said by Suetonius to
have uttered predictions to Vitellius
(Vitell. 14).

nee tanquam facerent deas} In
this remark Tacitus satirizes the
solly of the Roman emperors in
deifying the female members of their
families. Nero's infant daughter
had divine honours paid her (A.
xv. 23, “Adulationes censentium
honorem divae et pulvinar aedemque
et sacerdotem ''), and afterwards the
same compliuient was paid to Pop-
paea herself. Tacitus elsewhere
(H. iv. 61) says, “plerasque femi-
narum saudivas, et augescente super-
stitione arbitrantur deas‚'' but this
means, I think, that they really are
superstitious enough to believe in
their divinity. Here, he says. they
do not profess to inlici-e them divine
when they really do not.
