DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE.

Levissimus quisque Gallorum, et inopia audax, dubiae
possessionis solum occupavere. Mox limite acto pro-
motisque praesidiis, sinus imperii et pars provinciae

habentur.

XXX. Ultra hos Chatti initium sedis ab Hercynio
saltu inchoant, non ita effusis ae palustribus locis, ut
ceterae civitates in quas Germania patescit: durant si-
quidem colles, paulatim rarescunt: et Chattos suos

Wurtemberg‚ and a small part of
Bavaria)‚ scized by the Romans,
when the Germans retreated towards
the East‚ and given by them to
Gauls aud immigrating Germans,
and then to their own veterans to
occupy, subject to a tax of one-
tenth of the produce. To keep off
the hostile Germans it was protected‚
probably under Domitian, by a
bank (‘linies'), from *the Rhine,
near cologne, to M. Taunus and
the Odenwald, and from Lorch to
Ratisb0n‚ on the Danube, by a
wall, of which traces still reniain.
Lands of the kind here described
were generally called ‘agri Decu-
mani.' Tacitus here ternis them
‘agri Decumates? perhaps because
the former phrase was used to de-
signate tithe lands in a regular
province, whereas those now alluded
to formed no province. v

XXX. Chatti] The country of
this people lay between the Main in
the south, and the sources of the
Elison (Alme) and Visurgis (We-
ser); and from the western-aid in
the west to the Sala (Saale) in
Franconia, occupying the modern
Hessian ‹listrict3 Hesse, in fact,
being only a form of Chatti. They
first occur in the campaigns of
Drusus, who defeated them, and
took their capital, Mattium. In
the great Marcomanic war they
made incursions into Upper Ger-
many and Rhaetia, and were after-
wards merged in the Franks, These
Chatti are probably the people men-
tioned by Caesar under the name of
Suevi, on which point see Dr. La-
tham’s note.

Hercynio] This is probably a
Keltic name from ‘ erchynn‚' · high:
and the Hercynian forest was, there-
fore, a treeaelad mountain range.
According to Caesar it ran from the
Rauraci (Eadm), parallel to tho
Danube, as far as the Daci; tra-
versing wurtemberg, Bohemia‚ and
Upper Hungary : it then turned
North, and after encircling Hun-
gzary, reapproached the Danube in
'l'ransylvania. Thus it would com-
prise the ranges of the Schwan-
wald, Odenwaldv Rh6n, Thiiringer-
wald, Ha12‚Rauhe Alps, the En-
and Riesengebirge. Afterwards, the
name was confined to the mouu-
tains of Bohemia‚ extending into
Hungary.

durant siqnidem] This is an un-
usual position for ‘siquidem‚' but
Tacitus often adopts an order for his
conjunctions and prepositions usual
only with the poets οι· writers of the
silvei· age. For instance, he has
“ Amisiam et Luppiam amnes inter,
irritabat quinetiam, frueretur immo
iis,'' &a ς usages not to be copied.

durant siquidem colles <Sc-l ‘ the
hills are continuous, and gradually
sink away3 and the Hercyniam forest
accompanies its familiar Chatti, and
leaves them on leycl ground.' The
hills form a continuous range, and
the Chatti and the mountains are
co-extensive3 when the forest sinks
to the plain, the Chatti extend no
further. This plain may perhaps be
the valley of the Werra. ‘ prosequi·
is a word often used with reference
to escorting persons who are settin
out from home on some officia
errand. Cf. Liv. xxvi. 29, ‘ad pro-
