DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE. 51
et vinum mercantur. Cibi simplices: agrestia poma,
recens fera, aut lac concretum. Sine apparatu, sine
blandimentis expellunt famem. Adversus sitim non
eadem temperantia. Si indulseris ebrietati suggerendo
quantum concupiscunt, haud minus facile vitiis quam
armis vincentur.

XXIV. Genus spectaculorum unum, atque in omni
coetu idem. Nudi juvenes, quibus id ludicrum est, inter
gladios se, atque infestas frameas, saltu jaciunt. Exerci-
tatio artem paravit, ars decorem: non in quaestum tamen,
aut mercedem: quamvis audacis laesciviae pretium est,

necessarily imply any thing more that the Ger-mans were ever easily

than that an entire change had taken
place in the character of the liquid,
or that its true nature had been
perverted. When Virgil (G. ii. 46ῑὶ)
says, “liquidi casia corrumpitur
usus olivi,'' he only means, that to
mix oil with perfume, was a per-
version of its natural use. In an
account left of the old method of
making beer, in use amongst the
Britons and Kelts generally, we are
told the grain is steeped in water
until it germinates. lt is then dried
and ground, and mixed with water,
which is afterwards femiented.

recens sera] The Germans had
no fancy for tender meat, and there-
fore dressed it as soon as it was
killed. If the account of Pomponius
Mela be correct (iii. 3), they were
not even so particular as they are
here represented, and often ate their
meat raw.

lac concretum] According to
Caesar (vi. 21), an important item
in the sood of the Germans was
cheese (‘caseus'). Howevcr, as
Pliny (xi. 96) remarks, that it
was a strange thing that barbarous
nations had so long remained with-
out the knowledge of checse, Caesar
probably meant by this term the
curds ofmilk, coagulated by turning
sour, or artificial means.

haud minus simile] This sentence
is not quite so easy as it looks3 for
Tacitus could hardly intend to say

conquered by the Romans,—an
assertion notoriously the reverse of
true. What hc really means I
think is, that under the cirrum-
stances mentioned, the Germans
would be easily conquercd; and that
quite as much from their own fault
as the prowcss of the Romans.
There is a like condensation i‘n
H. ii. 69, ‘⁶ apud quos virtute quam
pecunia res Romana melius stetit ;''
i. e. Roman affairs were more
prosperousz and this p1·‹·sperity was
caused by their own excellence, not
by money.

XXIV. inter yladios] lt was a
common amusement amongst the
Greeks and Romans at banquets
and elsewhere to witness feats of
this description: Οὐ δήπου καὶ ἐς
μαχαίρας ’γε κυβιστᾶν (ἐπί-
σταιτο ἄν), Plato, Euthyd. 294, E.
According to Xenophon (Symp. ii.
ll), a circle was made of upright
swords, and the dancer tumbled in
and out again.

quumvis] This word has two uses
in Latin : it is employed to qualify
some adjective, as here it qualifics
‘audacis ς’ cf. Cic. ad Famil. ii. 16,
“eo si onere carerem, quamvis
parvis Italiae lambris contentus
essem ;'' or it is used as a con-
junction with verbs. Cf. Epist. ad
Attic. xvi. 7, “quamvis non fueris
suasor et impulsor profectionis meae,
approbator certe suisti.” In this
