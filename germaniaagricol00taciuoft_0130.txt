passe fidem faciunt: proximi Gallis, et similes sunt: seu
durante originis vi; seu, procurrentibus in diversa terris,
positio coeli corporibus habitum dedit: in universum
tamen aestimanti, Gallos vicinum solum occupasse credi·
bile est. Eorum saera deprehendas superstitionum per-
suasione: sermo haud multum diversus: in deposcendis
periculis eadem audaeia3 et, ubi advenere, in detrectandis
eadem formido ε plus tamen ferociae Britanni praeferunt,
ut quos nondum longa paxemollierit: nam Gallos quo-
que in bellis floruisse accepimus: mox segnitia cum otio
intravit, amissa virtute pariter ac libertate: quod Britan-

liam, inde in Africam transiturus,
trajecit.'⁵ The intermediate step
between the two with the ronoun,
is also found, Liv. xxviii. ὃ, “ non
ducem Romanum in Africam sese
trajecisse in hostilem terram.”

procurrentibus §ej According
to the view of the ancients, the
Gallie coast ran North-east, and the
British coast Soutlrwest. ‘In di-
versa' therefore does not mean the
same thing as ⁸ ex adverso :' which is
simply ‘opposite' Cf. H. iii. 13,
⁵ ex adverso legiones?

According to Strabo (iv. 5. 1)
Britain is triangular, its longest side
being parallel to Keltica, and ex-
tending like it about 4300 stadia.
Keltica reaches from the mouths of
the Rhine to the Northern extremi-
ties of the Pyrenees ς the side of Bri-
tain extends from Kent, its Eastem-
most point opposite the mouths of the
Rhine‚ to the Nl'estern extremity of
the island, which lies over against
Aquitania and the Pyrenees, This
makes the meaning of ‘in diversa'
very clear.

aestimanti] Sce the note on Germ.
c. 6, upon this phrase.

sermo hund mullum dt'wrsus] The
present Welsh is nearly connected
with the language of Brittany in
France. If the language of all
Britain was homogencous, and the
Breton tongue represents the ancient
Gallie, the remark of Tacitus is
'obviously true. lf tire Gaelic of
scotland be considered the nearest

representative of the Gallie tongue
as Tacitus meant it, then the re-
semblance,l suppose, would be much
less exact. Or, again, if following
the Welsh Triads the Lloegriau
branch of the Keltic stock be. sup-
posed to have occupied Eastern and
Southern Britain, and also a Lloe-
grian race France to the Mediter-
ranean Sea (see a paper on the Eth-
nology of England by Dr. Donaldson
in the Cambridge Essays, 1856), then
the assertion ‘sermo haud multum
diversus' would be grounded upon
undoubted fact. Th·

in deposcendis perimatis]
fickleness seems to have been uni-
versally an attribute of the Gaul.
In Apostolic days in Asia Minor
they were true to their character,—
“l marvel that ye are so soon re->
moved from him that called you.”
Caesar noticed the same fact (iii. 19).
Strabo too (iv. 4. 2) remarks that
the Gaul was always ready for fight-
ing. and passionate. Their lightness
of character however threw them into
consternation when at all worsted.
Τᾦ δὲ ἁπλῷ καὶ θυμικῷ πολὺ τὸ
ἀνόητον καὶ ἀλαζονικὸν πρόσεστι·
ὑπὸ τοιαύτης ὁὲ κουφότητος ἁφό-
ρητοι μὲν νικῶντες, ἐκπλαγεῖς δ’
ἡττηθέντες ὁρῶνται.

praeterunt] This is used for ‘ prae
se ferunt‚' A. ii. 53, ⁴· Vetera, suorum
facta dictaque praeferentes.” Also
A. xvi. 22, ⁸· Ut imperium evertant,
libertatem praeferunt.''
