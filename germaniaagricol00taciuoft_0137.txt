graviora, tanquam ex facili tolerantibus, imperentur:
singulos sibi olim reges fuisse, nunc binos imponi; e
quibus legatus in sanguinem, procurator in bona saeviret:
aeque discordiam praepositorum, aeque concordiam subjec-
tis exitiosam: alterius manus centuriones, alterius, servos
vim et contumelias miscere: nihil jam cupiditati, nihil
libidini exceptum: in proelio fortiorem esse, qui spoliet:
nunc ab ignavis plerumque et imbellibus eripi domos,
abstrahi liberos, injungi delectus, tanquam mori tantum
pro patria nescientibus: quantulum enim transisse mili-

XV. az· sbcili] There are many
adjectives used in this way with
‘ ex' adverbially. The following,
besides the one in the text, occur in
Tacitus: ‘ ex adfluenti: ‘ ex aequo.'
Livy has ‘ex improviso,' ‘ex com-
posito: ‘ex pmeparat0,' ‘ex tuto‚' ‘ cx
vano: ‘ ex insperato? Later in-
stances are ‘ex abnndanti‚' ‘ ex dis-
simulato: ‘ex professo,' ‘ex conti-
nenti,' ‘ex pari,' ‘ex integrm³ Cicero
has ‘ ex improviioss ‘ ex occulto)

sinyulos] Formerly they had one
king a-piece; nou· in each case they
had two. It does no't mean, of
course. that the two were in each
case different, but that every tribe
had received a double ruler in lieu
of their own single one.

in sanyuinem . . . . saeviret] Cf.
A. xii. 34, “Quorum virtute vacui
a. securibus et tributis,” of the
‘legatus ' and ‘ procurator' re-
s ectively. The former would have
the power of life and death·‚ the
latter would seize their goods in
ntisfaztion of fiscal claims.

The subjunctive of the verb here
is either that of the Oratio obliqua,
in which case the clause might be
replaced by ‘ e quibus legatum sae-
vire,'—a construction usual enough
in speeches thrown into narrative,—
or it is the =subjunctive of ‘ purpose,'
and equivalent to ‘ut ex iis legatus
saeviret!

alterius manus ‹j-c] ‘ Centurions,
the violent crew of the one, and
slaves the crew of the other, com-
bined violence aud insults.' This

is an awkwardly worded sentence,
isit is correct3 for ⁸ manus alterius'
is abruptly explained by ‘centu-
riones' The violence would be
mainly due to the centurions‚ the
insults to the slaves. The former
are the military officials of the
‘legatus ς’ the latter the ministers
of the ‘ procurator.' Cf. A. xiv. 31,
“Quod contra vertit, adeo ut reg-
num per centurione-S, domus per
servos velut, capta vastarentur.''
Ritter omits ‘manum' as a gloss3
but it does not seem absolutely
necessary to reject it, although the
sentence is certainly better without
it.

libidini emt-eptam] ‘nothing is
lest secure from their avarice and
lust.‘ Here the dative is the usual
nne after verbs of taking away. Cf.
Virg. Aen. ix. 270, “Clipeum cris-
tasque rubentes, Excipiam sorti.''

delectus] In H. i. 70 British
troops are mentioned with Galli and
Lusitani as serving under Caecina,
in the Vitellian war. A British
levy of 8000 men is mentioned as
forming a part of Vitellius' own
division, after the battle of Bed-
n'acum.

quantulum enim transisse]
Oratio directa of this would. be
‘quantulum militum transivit! In
the Oratio obliqua the indicative
becomes the infinitive. Cf. A. i. 17,

media ?'' A. ii. 2, “Ubi illam
