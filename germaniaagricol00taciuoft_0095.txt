type. Even the worst of his own
emperors, cloaking their tyranny
under a guise, however thin, of von-
stitutionalism, would hardly realize
his idea of ‘rex.' Cf. A. xvi. 23,
and H. v. 8.

XLV. aliud mare] By this Taci-
tus means the North Sea, on the
WVestern coast of Norway, stretcliiiig
up to the Arctic Ocean. He de-
scribes this sea, beyond the Shctland
Islands, in which Thule was situated‚
in similar ternis in the Agricola (c.
10). For his subsequent remarks
about the sun cf. Agricola, c. 12.

emeryentis] This has nothing to
do with the belief prevalent amongst
the ancients, that when the sun sets
in the W'est, his descent into the
Ocean is attended with hissings such
as Juvenal mentions. xiv, 280, ‘ Au-
diet Herculem* &c., and Statius, Syl.
ii. 7. 25,

is.

Tacitus is not speaking of the ex-
treme West, but of the North,
bending towards the East: at least
this seems to be h's view from what
he says below, ‘occidentis insulis‚'
&c.

formasque deorum] ' The com-
mentators discuss the question who
these gods were. 1 should not sup—
pose that any articular gods are
meant. Possib y the plienomena
attending the Aurora Borealis were
the origin of the whole story.

Matrem deum venerantur :

Illuc usque . . . natura] I hardly
think any of the explanations of this
passage satisfactory: at the same
time I can suggest nothing better
than that of Lipsius, Ritter, and
others, who point off ⁸ ct fania vera,'
and make it opposed to 'persuasio
adjicit,' as introducing :in undoubted
fact: ‘so far only, and the report is
certainly true (whatever the credi-
bility ofthc former vagno reports), na-
ture reaches ' Tacitus means that the
habitable portion of the earth ends
there. just as in Agricola 33, he says,
“nec inglorium t‘uerit in ipso ter-
rarum ac naturae tine ce‹·i‹lisso.”

Aestiorum flentes] These people
—the nien of the Eam—occupied
tho coast of Easteru Prussia and
Courland: the mention of the amber
trade decides this. By the ‘mare
Suevicum,’ along which they ex-
tendcd, 'rm-itus may, as Dr. Latham
remarks, mean the sea east of Swe-
dcn, the word ‘ Suevicus' being the
adjective from Suiones, as well as
from Suevi, although there is no
absolute necessity to suppose this.

ritus] This ‘ritus' is explained
direetly after to be the worship of
Mother Barth, also prevalentaniongst
the Suevi.

linqua Britannicae propior] This
remark is ingeniously explained by
Dr. Latham as follows: these people‚
inhabitants of Prussia, would spealc
a language termed Pryttise in its
German, or Prutskaja iu its slavonic
form. These are respectively like
Bryttisce and Britskaja, the German
and Slavonic designation of British3
