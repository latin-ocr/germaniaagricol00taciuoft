the reader to other books; only I have learned the
unwillingness of boys to make use of such references,
even when they have the books requisite. I have put
together the main passages from other authors, Greek or
Latin, wherein the chief knowledge of Germany and Bri-
tain, possessed by the ancients‚ is stored up3 and the most
interesting of these extracts are translated into English,
as more easily catching the eye in running them over,
and to induce younger readers to look at them, which
they might not do at all, if they had to be read in a
foreign and painful language. Ι ought to mention the
books to which I am most indebted for help. They are
Forbiger’s ‘Handbuch der alten Geographie‚’ v. 3rd3
Dr. Latham's ⁶ Germania3’ Ritter’s ‘Tacitus ;’ Dr.
Smith’s ‘Dictionaries ;’ and Wex's ‘Agricola.’
