DE MORIBUS GERMANIAE.

1X. Deorum maxime Mercurium colunt, cui, certis

diebus, humanis quoque hostiis litare fas habent.
culem ac Martem concessis animalibus placant:

IX. Mercurium] Tacitus might
have identified the Teutonic
deities with the govls of Rome on
either of two principles, simi-
larity of name, or similarity of
offices and attributes, The first
of these might be sub¹ ivided again,
perlutus, into similarsty of name,
compared to the Hellenic onds, or
their us <null Roman equivalents.
For instam ce, in the famous Iruiin-
sul, the old Saxon idol, there is a
root which might have recalled
Hermes, the Greek Mercury, and
this might bave suggested to Tacitus
the idea of rendering the. name of
this Teutonic god by liis own familiar
Mercurius. For more p‘irticulars
on th} s point D1.Latha1n s note on
the pass ιι, e should be consulted.

In this particular ease similarity
of attributes appears to h· ave decided
the ques ion. lVodan, the Scandi-
navian Odin was probably the god
represented as equivalent to Mer-
cuiius. He was the inventor of
magio, and all the ar3ts and the
fourth day of tlie week was named
after him, Χῗοᾶθιιειίιις οιιι· W ed-
nesday. ln these reesp ets he co-
incided with Men-urias, after whom
the same da) uas ca'led Dies Mer-
cur,ii the F'1ench Me1·01edi.'rhat
the two ον’,ειιιθ pondcd is exprsc ssli
stated bx· the old uriteims Paulus
Dias-onus (De gestis Langobar-do
rum, i. 9), sais ‘lVodan sane
quem adjecta littera Guodan dixe-
runt ipse est qui apud Romanos
Me1ffcu1ius dicitur. ’ Although, of
couise, evidence so late as this
(A. D. 700- 800) is not ver) valu-
ahle, still it goes fi» »r som‹thing
Caesar makes Mercurius the chief
god of the G:(1uls (vi. 17) and ob-
series that the Geimans have no
deities δε) oni the powers of nature,
the Sun, Μοοιι and Fit-‚e This
might be his own inference from

Her-
pars

their having no temples. If either
he or Tacitus had given us the
Keltic or Teutonic equivalents ιο·
these Rman nameS, it would have
sai ed a good deal of trouble.

Herculem] The Scandinavian
deity alwa)s represented with a
club, distinguished for strena t,th the
eneiny of the giants, and the de-
stro—xer of every thing noxious, was
Thor: he may have been theiefore
the equivalenti? of Hercules. Others,
however, make this equivalence
one of names; regar-(ling Hercules
as a latinized rendering of a name
compounded of Her and Keule,
brave with the club.'

stlta-lem] Perhaps this repre-
sents the god Τμ· the bravest of
the. race, xgvho is described in the
Edda as alone venturing to put his
hand in the wolf's mouth. More—
over. the old name for Tuesday,
or Dies Martis, was Tyrsdag, and
these facts point to the identity of
the two. As to the possibility of
the Greek Ares being the connect-
inglink, consult Dr. Latham‘s note
on the pass age.

concessis animalibus] That is,
‘with animals lawfully used,' as
opposed to ‘humanis hostiis, 'men-
tioned before. These human sa-
crifices were by no means entirely
unknown at Rome. They were
formally abolished about a century
before the. birth of Christ3 but,
accoiding to ΡΙίιιι-’ s statement, the
tir-aethe was existing ἰιι his own
da). In fact instuu es were com-
mon throughout the world from
the belief that human life, as the
most valuahle of all things, must
be acceptahle to the go ls

Amongst the Germans the. custom
seems to have occasion illv taken a

(A. xiii. 57) that in a war be·
